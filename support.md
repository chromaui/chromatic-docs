# Support

The fastest way to get help is to search the docs and browse our [FAQ](FAQ).

Our team is spread across timezones for a quick turnaround time. Use our <a class="intercom-concierge-bot">in-app chat</a> to get in touch. Please provide details like version numbers, logs, and screenshots, to speed up troubleshooting.

If your question requires more context, contact us via [email](mailto:support@chromatic.com). We recommend using email as a last resort because it can take more time to respond.
