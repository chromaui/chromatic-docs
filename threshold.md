# Threshold for changes

The `diffThreshold` parameter allows you to fine tune the threshold for visual change between snapshots before they're flagged by Chromatic. Sometimes you need assurance to the sub-pixel and other times you want to skip visual noise generated by non-deterministic rendering such as anti-aliasing.

## Setting the threshold

Chromatic's default threshold is `.063` which balances high visual accuracy with low false positives (for example, from artifacts like anti-aliasing). `0` is the most accurate. `1` is the least accurate.

Configure the `diffThreshold` with a Storybook [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters#story-parameters) like so:

```js
// MyComponent.js

import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

export default {
  component: MyComponent,
};

const Template = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />; 

export const StoryName = Template.bind({});
StoryName.args = {};
StoryName.parameters = {
  // Sets the diffThreshold for 0.2 for a specific story.
  chromatic: { diffThreshold: 0.2 },
};
```
