# Threshold for changes

The `diffThreshold` parameter allows you to fine tune the threshold for visual change between snapshots before they're flagged by Chromatic. Sometimes you need assurance to the sub-pixel and other times you want to skip visual noise generated by non-deterministic rendering such as anti-aliasing.

## Setting the threshold

Chromatic's default threshold is `.063` which balances high visual accuracy with low false positives (for example, from artifacts like anti-aliasing). `0` is the most accurate. `1` is the least accurate.

Interactively demo different `diffThreshold` values with [this tool](https://6262c53f521620003ac2ff49-ukmsdlppcb.chromatic.com/?path=/story/stories-diff-threshold-check--test-yours-out).

Configure the `diffThreshold` with a Storybook [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters#story-parameters) like so:

```js
// MyComponent.stories.js|jsx

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  title: 'MyComponent',
};

const Template = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;

export const StoryName = Template.bind({});
StoryName.args = {
  with: 'props',
};
StoryName.parameters = {
  // Sets the diffThreshold for 0.2 for a specific story.
  chromatic: { diffThreshold: 0.2 },
};
```
