# How to view the number of snapshots used in Chromatic

When you sign up to Chromatic, youâ€™ll get a fixed number of snapshots based your plan of choice.

At anytime you can view your current snapshot usage.

Start by logging into [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) and click the `Billing` icon in the sidebar.

Under the `Plan` section you'll find not only how many snapshots you've used for the current month but also additional information related to your subscribed plan.

Let us know through our <a href="/intercom" onclick="event.preventDefault();openIntercom();"><b>in-app chat</b></a> if you have questions about snapshot usage, or see our [snapshot documentation](snapshots) for more information.
