# Chromatic workflow

Chromatic automates building and maintaining a UI component library. That means you can do more with less manual work. Let's go over the recommended workflow so you can take full advantage of our tools.

### 1. Build in Storybook

### 2. Publish on Chromatic

This is useful when you want to change behavior of all stories when rendered in Chromatic.

### 3. UI Tests to catch bugs

### 4. UI Review to get team sign off

### 5. Document to reuse later

### 6. Merge with confidence
