# Chromatic workflow

Chromatic automates maintaining a UI component library so you can develop more features with less manual work. Here's the recommended workflow that takes full advantage of everything we have to offer.

### 1. Build in Storybook

Build UI components in isolation with Storybook. Use [Component-Driven Development](https://blog.hichroma.com/component-driven-development-ce1109d56c8e), a process for building UIs from the "bottom up" starting with components and ending with screens.

### 2. Publish on Chromatic

Publish Storybook to a secure workspace (CDN) that's accessible to your entire team. That keeps everyone in sync with the latest UI implementation. No fussing with dependencies, `git`, or local dev environments.

### 3. UI Test to catch bugs

Once Storybook is published in the cloud, Chromatic's cloud infrastructure can automate UI tests to catch regressions. Developers find and fix UI bugs during development. When the tests pass, the UI is considered "ready" and moves on to review.

### 4. UI Review to get team sign off

Now that the UI has no obvious flaws, bring in designers, PMs, and other stakeholders to confirm that the UI meets specifications. Developers often fill in edge cases and overcome technical hurdles while coding. Review is the opportunity to sync those updates with teammates to get a final sign off before merging.

### 5. Document to reuse later

When the UI is production-ready, document it so future developers don't have to rebuild the same thing. This is automatic with Chromatic. Every component is documented, versioned, and searchable in the cloud.

<div class="aside">Tip: Use <a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/docs" target="_blank">Storybook Docs</a> to auto-generate minimum viable docs which can be further customized as your needs grow.</div>

### 6. Merge with confidence

ðŸš€ You're ready to merge! When you build components in Storybook you also unlock Chromatic's automated cloud services for testing, review, and documentation.
