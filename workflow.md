# Chromatic workflow

How to get the most out of Chromatic. Chromatic gives you a lot of tools. Here's how to use all of them together.

Chapter 8 illustrates the end-to-end design system workflow we created in this guide. Weâ€™ll see how UI changes ripple outward from the design system.

How frontend tools work together has a significant impact on the ultimate value design and development teams can realize. When done well, it should be seamless to develop and reuse UI components.

This chapter showcases the five-step workflow by introducing a new component AvatarList.

### 1. Publish Storybook

This is useful when you want to change behavior of all stories when rendered in Chromatic.

### 2. UI Tests by yourself

### 3. UI Review with stakeholders

### 4.
