# Delay snapshots

Components sometimes trigger custom interactions on render. For example, JavaScript-driven [animations](animations#javascript-animations) that cannot [otherwise be disabled](test#false-positives) or third-party functionality outside of your control.

You can delay capture for a fixed time to allow your story to get into the intended state. Using delay requires Storybook 4.0 or later.

The maximum time for snapshot capture is 15s. Your story should finish loading resources and be ready to capture in 15s.

## Delay a story

Use [story-level](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters#story-parameters) delay to ensure a minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) has passed before Chromatic takes a screenshot.

```js
// MyComponent.stories.js|jsx

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  title: 'MyComponent',
};

const Template = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;

export const StoryName = Template.bind({});
StoryName.args = {
  with: 'props',
};
StoryName.parameters = {
  // Sets the delay for a specific story.
  chromatic: { delay: 300 },
};
```

This technique is intended for interactions and animations that end after a certain period of time (e.g., "animate in"). If your animation is continuous and you cannot disable it, you may need to use an [ignore region](ignoring-elements) to stop Chromatic from considering such parts of your component.

## Delay all stories of a component

Chromatic uses Storybookâ€™s built in [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters#component-parameters) API to make it straightforward to set delay on a group of stories:

```js
// MyComponent.stories.js|jsx

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  parameters: {
    // Sets a delay for the component's stories
    chromatic: { delay: 300 },
  },
  title: 'MyComponent',
};

const Template = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;

export const StoryName = Template.bind({});
StoryName.args = {
  with: 'props',
};

export const SecondStoryName = Template.bind({});
SecondStoryName.args = {
  with: 'other-props',
};
```
