Our priority is securing your intellectual property and sensitive information. Download an overview (PDF) of our security policy [here](assets/Chroma-Security-Policy.pdf).

## SOC 2

Chromatic is [SOC 2 Type 1](https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement) compliant. This rigorous, independent assessment of our internal security controls serves as validation of our dedication to the highest standards for security, availability, and confidentiality.

## Responsible disclosure

Our team is vigilant about adhering to security best practices. But we're not so naive to believe that we're perfect. Security is a priority â€“ we'll act quickly to address verifiable security issues.

Please report security issues to [security@chromatic.com](mailto:security@chromatic.com). Include your name, vulnerability description, and steps to reproduce.
