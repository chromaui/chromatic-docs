# Security and responsible disclosure

The Chromatic team is vigilant about adhering to security best practices. But we're not so naive to believe that we're perfect. Security is a priority â€“ we'll act quickly to address verifiable security issues.

Please report security issues to [security@chromatic.com](mailto:security@chromatic.com) that includes your name, vulnerability description, and steps to reproduce.
