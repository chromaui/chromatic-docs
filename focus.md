# Focus

Chromatic renders your story in the state that Storybook renders it in. This means if you focus an element as part of the rendering of the story, the element will be in a focussed state.

However, Chromatic hides the caret (flashing cursor) as otherwise it will cause intermittent changes to your stories that require approval.
