### 🚀 Project Structure

This project uses Astro. Inside, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── getStarted/
│   │   └── introduction.md
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

### 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## ✍️ Editing Content

Try to follow the conventions present.

### Content

All content lives in `src/content`

### Sidebar

The sidebar is autogenerated. Use the `sidebar` property in the frontmatter to control the order and label of the sidebar item. eg: `sidebar: { order: 1, label: 'Introduction' }`

### Media

Any static assets, like gifs and videos, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Any static images added to `src` directory will be optimized and copied to `public/` during the build process.

Add the center css class to center media horizontally if they aren't full screen.

### Search

Algolia's Docsearch is integrated with the project. Every 24 hours it will crawl docs.chromatic.com and update it's index. The search input box is wired up to this index. You don't need to do anything special, whatever is pushed to docs.chromatic.com will be automatically indexed.
