## ✍️ Editing Content

Try to follow the conventions present.

### Content

All content lives in `src/content`

### Sidebar

The sidebar is autogenerated. Use the `sidebar` property in the frontmatter to control the order and label of the sidebar item. eg: `sidebar: { order: 1, label: 'Introduction' }`

### Media

Any static assets, like gifs and videos, can be placed in the `public/` directory. You'll have to manually add the `/docs` prefix for these urls.

Any static images added to `src` directory will be optimized and copied to `public/` during the build process.

Add the center css class to center media horizontally if they aren't full screen.

### Search

Algolia's Docsearch is integrated with the project. Every 24 hours it will crawl docs.chromatic.com and update it's index. The search input box is wired up to this index. You don't need to do anything special, whatever is pushed to docs.chromatic.com will be automatically indexed.
