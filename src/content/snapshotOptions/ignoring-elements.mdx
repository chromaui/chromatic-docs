# Ignore tests and elements

Sometimes a component's appearance changes every render or contains content like video and [animation](/docs/animations) that is impossible to test consistently. This will trigger visual changes even when the component code hasn't changed. Ignore tests or DOM elements to tell Chromatic to skip them when looking for changes.

## Ignore tests

By default, Chromatic captures snapshots for all your UI components, whether you're testing with Storybook or with the E2E integration (i.e., [Playwright](/docs/playwright) or [Cypress](/docs/cypress)), ensuring your UI remains consistent at all times. However, you may want to ignore specific tests that are irrelevant or cause false positives. 

### With Storybook

If you're running tests with Storybook, you can enable the ` disableSnapshot` option to configure Chromatic to ignore stories and prevent them from being snapshotted. This is useful if you're adopting Chromatic incrementally and want to turn off snapshotting for specific stories or work with components that could contain dynamic content or animations that may trigger unwanted visual changes.

```ts title="src/components/NotFound.stories.ts|tsx"
// Adjust this import to match your framework (e.g., nextjs, vue3-vite)
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/your-framework";

/*
 * Replace the @storybook/test package with the following if you are using a version of Storybook earlier than 8.0:
 * import { within } from "@storybook/testing-library";
 * import { expect } from "@storybook/jest";
 */
import { expect, within } from "@storybook/test";

import { NotFound } from "./NotFound";

const meta: Meta<typeof NotFound> = {
  component: NotFound,
  title: "NotFound",
  parameters: {
    // Disables Chromatic's snapshotting on a component level
    chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
  },
};

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof NotFound>;

export const Default: Story = {
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement);
    await expect(canvas.getByText("Page not found")).toBeInTheDocument();
  },
};
```

<ParamsCallout name="disableSnapshot" integration="storybook" />

### With Playwright or Cypress

By default, Chromatic's Playwright and Cypress integrations run tests and captures a snapshot at the end of each E2E test; either it passes or fails. However, if you've enabled targeted snapshots with [Playwright](/docs/playwright/targeted-snapshots) or [Cypress](/docs/cypress/targeted-snapshots) to pinpoint visual changes when the test reaches a specific point, you can opt out of the automated snapshotting process by enabling the `disableAutoSnapshot` configuration option. This is useful when capturing snapshots at specific points in your test, such as when a particular element is visible or when a specific action is performed.

## Ignore DOM elements

To ignore specific elements in your UI, add the `.chromatic-ignore` class or `data-chromatic="ignore"` attributes to the elements you want Chromatic to skip. Enabling these attributes notifies Chromatic's diffing algorithm to disregard the pixels when running your UI tests and comparing snapshots for visual changes, including the element's bounding box and position (e.g., width, height, and relative positioning).
 
```tsx title="src/components/VideoComponent.ts|tsx"
import React from "react";

interface VideoPlayerProps {
  src: string
  datePublished?: string
}

export const VideoPlayer: React.FC<VideoPlayerProps> = ({
  src,
  datePublished = new Date().toLocaleString(),
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <video data-chromatic="ignore" src={src} controls>
        Your browser does not support video tags.
      </video>
      <p className="chromatic-ignore">Published on: {datePublished}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Frequently asked questions

<details>

<summary>Why isn't an element with <code>data-chromatic="ignore"</code> being ignored?</summary>

Adding the `data-chromatic="ignore"` attribute instructs the diffing algorithm to disregard pixels within the bounding box of the ignored element. However, dimension changes of this element still trigger a change.

Ensure that both the baseline and new snapshots maintain the exact dimensions, such as width, height, and relative positioning.

![Chromatic will not trigger a change because the dimensions of the ignored element remain the same, even though the contents have changed.](../../images/ignore-but-still-changes.png)

<details>
<summary>Why are disabled stories still listed?</summary>

If you enable the `disabledSnapshot` configuration option to prevent your stories from being snapshotted, Chromatic will continue to index them and display them in the Library view. However, the "Snapshot" tab will no longer be visible in the UI for these stories. To remove the story altogether, you will need to delete it from your Storybook.
