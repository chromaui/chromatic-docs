# Delay snapshots

Components sometimes trigger custom interactions on render. For example, JavaScript-driven [animations](/docs/animations#javascript-animations) that cannot [otherwise be disabled](/docs/troubleshooting-snapshots) or third-party functionality outside of your control. The `delay` configuration option enables you to define a fixed minimum time to wait before capturing a snapshot, allowing your tests to get into the intended state before Chromatic snapshots it.

## Customizing snapshot delays

Chromatic's maximum wait time before capturing a snapshot is 15 seconds, providing a balance for your tests to load resources and be ready for snapshotting. If you need to customize the wait time for Chromatic to capture a snapshot, add the `delay` configuration option to your tests. For example:

<IntegrationSnippets>
  <Fragment slot="storybook">
  ```ts title="src/components/Categories.stories.ts|tsx"
  // Adjust this import to match your framework (e.g., nextjs, vue3-vite)
  import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/your-framework";

  /*
   * Replace the @storybook/test package with the following if you are using a version of Storybook earlier than 8.0:
   * import { within } from "@storybook/testing-library";
   * import { expect } from "@storybook/jest";
   */
  import { expect, within } from "@storybook/test";

  import { Categories } from "./Categories";

  const meta: Meta<typeof Categories> = {
    component: Categories,
    title: "Categories",
    parameters: {
      // Sets the delay (in milliseconds) at the component level for all stories.
      chromatic: { delay: 300 },
    },
  };

  export default meta;
  type Story = StoryObj<typeof Categories>;

  export const Default: Story = {
    play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
      const canvas = within(canvasElement);
      await expect(canvas.getByText("Available Categories")).toBeInTheDocument();
    },
  };

      });
    });

Enabling the `delay` configuration in your tests is especially useful when you have an asynchronous action or animations that end after a specific time (e.g., "animate in") to ensure that your component is in the intended state before Chromatic captures a snapshot. However, if you're working with a continuous animation or a third-party element you cannot deactivate, you may need to use an [ignore region](/docs/ignoring-elements) to prevent Chromatic from considering such parts of the UI.

### Use assertions to delay snapshot capture

If you need additional control when Chromatic captures a snapshot, you can adjust your tests to rely on [interaction testing](/docs/interactions) via Storybook's [`play`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function) function, use custom assertions and timeouts with the E2E integration (i.e., [Playwright](/docs/playwright), or [Cypress](/docs/cypress)), verifying that the UI is in the required state before the snapshot is taken. Chromatic waits for the assertions to pass before capturing the snapshot.
