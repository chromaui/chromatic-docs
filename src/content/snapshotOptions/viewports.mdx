# Viewports for responsive UIs with breakpoints

UI components respond and adapt to different device widths. Chromatic streamlines visual testing, enabling you to capture each test at multiple viewport sizes.

## Storybook

For Storybook, viewports are configured using the [Modes API](/docs/modes), which allows you to set global configurations that affect how a component renders (e.g., viewport size, theme & locale).

Chromatic also integrates with Storybook's viewport feature. You can specify viewports by the names configured in Storybook's `.storybook/preview.js` file. And if a story has a `defaultViewport` set, Chromatic will automatically use that to capture the snapshot.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [**configure viewports for stories**](/docs/storybook/viewports) page.

## Playwright

Chromatic will capture the DOM and take snapshots at the viewport size in which a test is configured to run.

[Viewports in Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation#viewport) can be configured globally in your main Playwright configuration file as follows:

```ts title="playwright.config.js|ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
      },
    },
    {
      name: "Mobile",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        viewport: { width: 500, height: 600 },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Or at the test level:

```ts title="Viewports.spec.js|ts"
test.describe("Page display on medium size screen", () => {
  // üëá Overrides the option in the test.
  test.use({
    viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 },
  });

  test("Does not display sidebar", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");
  });
});
```

## Cypress

Chromatic will capture the DOM and take snapshots at the viewport size in which a test is configured to run.

[Viewports in Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) can be configured [globally in your main Cypress configuration file](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport#Default-sizing) as follows:

```ts title="cypress.config.js|ts"
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";

export default defineConfig({
  viewportWidth: 1000,
  viewportHeight: 660,
});
```

Or using [configuration at the test level](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport#Set-viewport-in-the-test-configuration):

```ts title="cypress/e2e/Viewports.cy.js|ts"
describe(
  "Page display on medium size screen",
  {
    // üëá Overrides the option in the test.
    viewportHeight: 1000,
    viewportWidth: 400,
  },
  () => {
    it("Does not display sidebar", () => {
      cy.visit("/");
    });
  },
);
```

<div class="aside">

‚ÑπÔ∏è Currently, setting the viewport using `cy.viewport()` is not supported.
