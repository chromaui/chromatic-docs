# Take targeted snapshots with Cypress

By default, Chromatic takes a snapshot at the end of every Cypress test, whether it passes or fails. However, you can also choose to programmatically take snapshots at specific points in your tests using the `takeSnapshot` function inside your test runs.

`takeSnapshot` is especially useful for capturing a snapshot of your UIâ€™s appearance when your UI reaches a specific state mid-test:

```js
describe("My First Test", () => {
  it("Visits the Kitchen Sink", () => {
    // ðŸ‘‡ Navigate to target page
    cy.visit("https://example.cypress.io");

    // ðŸ“¸ Tell Chromatic to take a snapshot of the initial page state
    cy.takeSnapshot();

    // ðŸ‘‡ Finish the test by opening the dropdown menu
    cy.get(".dropdown:first-of-type > .dropdown-toggle").click();

    // You can call takeSnapshot multiple times if necessary.
    // To help disambiguate, you can give the snapshot a name, 
    // which is passed as an argument to takeSnapshot.
    cy.takeSnapshot("After opening dropdown");

    // ðŸ“¸ Chromatic automatically takes a snapshot here, at the end of the test. 
  });
});
```
