**Web Beacon Overview and How They are Used on Our Website**

The pages of our Website contain images (called a “single-pixel gif” or “web beacons”) that allow our third-party service providers and us to count page views or to collect other anonymous data.

Web beacons are typically very small, usually 1 by 1 pixel in size, but their presence can be easily seen with your browser’s inspection tools. Web beacons are small in order to minimize both their display and their loading time. Our web beacons may collect, gather, monitor or share personal information about our online service visitors for web tracking purposes; they also may be used to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about the usage of our online services.

For tracking purposes, we use web beacons on our Website along with other technical methods. We also employ third-party services (e.g., Twitter) that collect data remotely through the use of web beacons. This service then returns the completely anonymous data to us as site traffic reports.

**Use for new purposes.**  We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.  If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.

**Sensitive personal information.**  We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the services, or otherwise to us.

If you provide us with any sensitive personal information when you use the services, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through the services.

**Automated Decision-Making and Profiling.**  We do not use automated decision-making and/or profiling in regard to your personal information in connection with the services.

**Retention.**  We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.  If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**Your rights.**

European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information.  If you are located within the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:
