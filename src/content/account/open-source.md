# Open source sponsorships

Chromatic sponsors open source component libraries and design systems with free usage. As open source maintainers ourselves, we know how tough it can be to get professional tools that'll help your project grow.

Chromatic supports the open source workflow out of the box. We mirror repository permissions for maintainers while allowing read-only access to viewers.

## What's the eligibility criteria for OSS sponsorship?

Chromatic offers a free plan (35k snapshots per month, Chrome only) to open-source design systems or UI component libraries that meet the following criteria:

- Community-led project with any of the following:
  - Over 100 contributors
  - Over 40k weekly npm DLs
  - Over 10k GitHub stars
- UI library or design system built specifically for a company:
  - Over 5 contributors
- UI library or design system built for Government organizations:
  - Over 5 contributors
  - Must be a national-level or higher organization (e.g., European Union, Gov.UK, US Digital Service), not a local or municipal organization (e.g., State of Massachusetts).

## Considerations

Open Source Storybooks are [**publicly visible**](/docs/collaborators#visibility). Custom domains can be set up for Open Source accounts, even for [free ones](/docs/permalinks#prerequisites).
