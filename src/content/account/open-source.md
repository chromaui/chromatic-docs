# Open source sponsorships

Chromatic sponsors open source component libraries and design systems with free usage. As open source maintainers ourselves, we know how tough it can be to get professional tools that'll help your project grow.

Chromatic supports the open source workflow out of the box. We mirror repository permissions for maintainers while allowing read-only access to viewers.
