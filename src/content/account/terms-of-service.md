## 4. Non-Chroma Providers

Chroma is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from access by a Non-Chroma Application.

**4.2. Integration with Non-Chroma Applications**

Chroma Services may contain features designed to interoperate or integrate with certain Non-Chroma Applications. To use such features, Customer may be required to obtain access to such Non-Chroma Applications subject to their terms and conditions, or to grant Chroma access to Customer’s account(s) on such Non-Chroma Applications. If the provider of a Non-Chroma Application ceases to make the Non-Chroma Application available for interoperation or integration with the corresponding Service features on reasonable terms, Chroma may, at its sole discretion, cease providing those Service features without providing Customer any prior notice, refund, credit, or other compensation.

## 5. Fees Payment and Terms Audit

**5.1 Fees and Expenses**

For purchased Chroma Services and Support, Customer will pay Chroma the fees set forth in the applicable Subscription Order.

**5.2 Payment Terms**

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in an applicable Subscription Order, Chroma will charge Customer credit card at the interval specified in an applicable order invoice as follows:

- (a) For Services, upon execution of the applicable Subscription Order; and
- (b) for Training Services, monthly in-arrears as such Services are delivered by Chroma.

Customer will pay all such invoices issued by Chroma in full within thirty (30) days of receiving each invoice, without setoff, counterclaim, or deduction of any kind. All unpaid amounts will accrue interest at the rate of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. Chroma may, in its sole discretion, suspend the provision of Services or Support, as applicable, (i) upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Customer, if any invoice is more than thirty (30) days past due, or (ii) immediately if Customer is a non-enterprise, self-service customer paying by credit card, and said credit card payment has been declined after reasonable attempts. This right of suspension will not limit any other of Chroma’s rights or remedies related to Customer’s failure to pay. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Chroma's measurements of your use of the Chroma Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. Nothing in these Terms obligates Chroma to extend credit to any party. Chroma may change its fees and payment policies for the Chroma Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the Chromatic website (or such other URL Chroma may provide from time to time). Customer acknowledges and agrees that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Chroma may be shared by Chroma with companies who work on Chroma’s behalf, such as accounting firms, payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Chroma and servicing your account.

**5.3 Refunds & Cancellation**

Customer may cancel and receive a full refund of fees paid within the first thirty (30) days of the initial service provisioning date for orders related to Chromatic. Chroma reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to issue any refunds in the form of credit towards future Chroma Services. After the aforementioned 30 days, any subsequent Chromatic orders associated to a Customer’s user account or previously associated web domains are not eligible for refund. Customer may only request a cancellation or refund via written notice to Chroma. In the event Customer terminates a Subscription Order without cause, Customer is responsible for all fees incurred unless a refund is expressly provided herein.

**5.4 Taxes**

All fees and expenses charged by Chroma under this Agreement are exclusive of any taxes, duties, or similar charges imposed by any government, and Customer agrees to pay for any and all federal, state, or local sales, use, excise, privilege, or other taxes, duties or assessments, however designated or levied, relating to this Agreement, exclusive of taxes based on Chroma’s net income. If Customer is required to pay any withholding tax, charge, or levy in respect of any payments due to Chroma hereunder, Customer agrees to gross up payments actually made to Chroma such that Chroma receives sums due hereunder in full and free of any deduction for any such withholding tax, charge, or levy.

Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Chroma, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Chroma has no obligation to do so on your behalf. By creating an Application and associated Data through use of the Chroma Services, you give Chroma a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Application and Data for the sole purpose of enabling Chroma to provide you with the Chroma Services.

**6.6 Reservation of Rights**

Chroma reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement. Except as expressly stated, nothing herein shall be construed to

Chroma reserves the right to take down content in Customer’s Application or, if necessary, the Application itself upon receipt of a valid DMCA notice.

## 7. Confidentiality

**7.1 Obligations**

For a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of the applicable Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will (i) hold the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in trust and confidence and avoid the unauthorized disclosure or release thereof to any other person or entity by using the same degree of care as the Receiving Party uses to avoid unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination of its own confidential information of a similar nature, but, in no event, less than a reasonable degree of care, and (ii) not use Confidential Information for any purpose except as expressly contemplated under this Agreement or any Subscription Order; provided that, to the extent, Confidential Information constitutes a trade secret under applicable law, the Receiving Party agrees to protect such information for so long as it qualifies as a trade secret. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to those of the Receiving Party’s employees and contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information, provided that the Receiving Party takes reasonable measures to ensure that such employees and contractors are bound by non-use and non-disclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. Each party shall be liable for all violations of this Section 7 by its employees and contractors.

**7.2 Exclusions**

- (i) was in the possession of the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure without any restrictions as to confidentiality of such information,
- (ii) was generally available to the public at the time of disclosure or became generally available to the public after disclosure through no breach of this Agreement or other wrongful act by the Receiving Party,
- (iii) was rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure, or
- (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required to comply with binding orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that, to the extent legally permitted, the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedies, discloses only such Confidential Information as is required by the governmental entity, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information disclosed.

**7.3 Return and Destruction**

Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy the Confidential Information, including all copies thereof (certifying the fact of such destruction to the Disclosing Party), with the exception that the Receiving Party

- (a) may retain an archival copy of the Confidential Information and
- (b) is not required to destroy or alter computer-based back-up files generated in the normal course of its business.

Any Confidential Information contained in such archival copies or backup files shall, however, remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Section 7.

**7.4 Equitable Relief**

The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach of the obligations of this Section 7 may cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm for which an adequate remedy at law may not be available and that, therefore, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to all other remedies available at law.

  - (ii) a trustee or receiver is appointed for such other party or for a substantial portion of its assets or

## 10. Indemnification

**10.1 General**

Each party (the “Indemnitor”) agrees, at its own expense, to

- (a) Defend the other party, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (the 'Indemnitees') from and against any third party claim, suit, or action brought against any of the Indemnitees for death, bodily injury, or damage to or loss of any real or tangible personal property to the extent arising out of the Indemnitor's (including its employees and agents) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of this Agreement (each a “General Claim”), and
- (b) Indemnify the Indemnitees against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses finally awarded to an unaffiliated third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed by the Indemnitor in settlement with regard to any such General Claim.

Further, Chroma will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless at its expense, any third-party claim, action or proceeding (including resulting liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses finally awarded to an unaffiliated third party) against Customer, and its Indemnitees, that the Services infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third-party’s proprietary rights (a “Customer Infringement Claim”). Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless at its expense, any third-party claim, action or proceeding (including resulting liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses finally awarded to an unaffiliated third party) against Chroma, and its Indemnitees, that any Customer technology related to this Agreement infringes, misappropriates, or violates a third-party’s proprietary rights (a “Chroma Infringement Claim”).

**10.2 Conditions to Indemnification**

As conditions to indemnification under this Section 10, the indemnified party must (a) notify the indemnifying party promptly in writing of the General Claim, Customer Infringement Claim, or Chroma Infringement Claim, as applicable, for which the indemnified party is seeking indemnification, (ii) grant the indemnifying party sole control over the defense and settlement of each General Claim Customer Infringement Claim, or Chroma Infringement Claim, as applicable, and (iii) provide the indemnifying party with reasonable cooperation in response to such party’s requests for assistance. The indemnifying party may not settle or compromise a General Claim Customer Infringement Claim, or Chroma Infringement Claim, as applicable, without the prior written consent of indemnified party if such settlement includes an admission of liability on the part of the indemnified party.
