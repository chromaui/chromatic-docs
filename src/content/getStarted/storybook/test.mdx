# Run UI tests with Storybook

UI Tests pinpoint visual changes and verify user [interactions](/docs/interactions). They capture a [snapshot](/docs/snapshots) of every story in a cloud browser environment. Whenever you push code, Chromatic generates a new set of snapshots and compares them against [baseline snapshots](/docs/branching-and-baselines#whats-a-baseline). If there are changes, you verify that they’re intentional. If there are test errors, you get notified to fix them.

## Enable

Enable visual tests for your project on the manage page. If your stories have [interaction tests](/docs/interactions), they’ll run automatically when visual tests are enabled.

All snapshots are taken in Chrome by default. Select additional browsers to expand test coverage in 1-click.

<details>
<summary class="no-anchor">What about component errors?</summary>

When a story fails to render it will be badged with “Component Error”. You will not be able to “pass” a build that has component errors. Fix story errors in Storybook and run the build again.

<details>
<summary class="no-anchor">What about failed tests?</summary>

When interaction tests fail, the story will be badged with “Failed test.” You will not be able to “pass” a build that has failed tests. Fix interaction tests in Storybook and run the build again.

## PR check for “UI Tests”

Chromatic adds a ‘UI Tests’ check within the status checks for your pull/merge requests. The badge shows errors or changes that need to be reviewed. Require the check in [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#post-the-build-status-to-a-commit), or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge-856691474.html) to prevent accidental UI bugs from being merged.

CI setup: Chromatic will return an exit code 0 on the CLI which can be used in CI/CD systems to indicate success and unblock deployment. [Learn about CI](/docs/storybook/ci).
