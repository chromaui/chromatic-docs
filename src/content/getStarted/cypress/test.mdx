# Run visual tests with Cypress

Visual Tests are used to detect UI bugs down to the pixel. They capture a [snapshot](/docs/snapshots) of every Cypress test in a cloud browser environment. Whenever you push code, Chromatic generates a new set of snapshots and compares them against [baseline snapshots](/docs/branching-and-baselines#whats-a-baseline). If there are changes, you verify that they’re intentional. If there are test errors, you get notified to fix them.

## PR check for “UI Tests”

Chromatic reports the status of Cypress visual tests through the ‘UI Tests’ pull request check. The badge shows errors or changes that need to be reviewed. Require the check in [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#post-the-build-status-to-a-commit), or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge-856691474.html) to prevent accidental UI bugs from being merged.
