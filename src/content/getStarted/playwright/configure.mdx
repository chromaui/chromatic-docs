# Configure visual tests for Playwright

You can enhance your Playwright and Chromatic tests further by configuring them using the options outlined in the following sections.

## Playwright options

The Chromatic [Playwright Fixture](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) can be configured with `use` like all [Playwright options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options).

Setting options globally can be done in your `playwright.config.js` as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
    import { ChromaticConfig } from "@chromatic-com/playwright";

    export default defineConfig<ChromaticConfig>({
      use: {
        // ...

        // ðŸ‘‡ your option overrides
        disableAutoSnapshot: true,
      },
      // ... your other configuration
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // playwright.config.js

    import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

    export default defineConfig({
      use: {
        // ...

        // ðŸ‘‡ your global options
        disableAutoSnapshot: true,
      },
      // ... your other configuration
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Options can also be overridden at the test level:

```javascript
// mytest.spec.js

test.describe("some block", () => {
  // ðŸ‘‡ your option overrides
  test.use({ disableAutoSnapshot: true });

  test("some test", async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

## E2E options

These options control how the Chromatic archive fixture behaves.

| Option                   | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `disableAutoSnapshot`    | `boolean`       | When `true`, will disable the snapshot that happens automatically at the end of a test when using the Chromatic test fixture.                                                        |
| `resourceArchiveTimeout` | `number`        | Maximum amount of time that each test will wait for the network to be idle while archiving resources.                                                                                |
| `assetDomains`           | `array[string]` | A list of domains external to the test location that you want Chromatic to also capture assets from, e.g., <code style="display: inline;">['other-domain.com','our-cdn.com']</code>. |

## Chromatic options

These options control how Chromatic behaves when capturing snapshots of your pages.

| Option                    | Type      | Chromatic Docs                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delay`                   | `number`  | [Delay](/docs/delay/)                                                   |
| `diffIncludeAntiAliasing` | `boolean` | [Threshold for changes](/docs/threshold#anti-aliasing)                  |
| `diffThreshold`           | `number`  | [Threshold for changes](/docs/threshold#setting-the-threshold)          |
| `forcedColors`            | `string`  | [Media Features](/docs/media-features#test-high-contrast-color-schemes) |
| `pauseAnimationAtEnd`     | `boolean` | [Animations](/docs/animations#css-animations)                           |
| `prefersReducedMotion`    | `string`  | [Media Features](/docs/media-features#verify-reduced-motion-animations) |

## Environment variables

Some options can be configured through environment variables.

| Environment variable         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` | If you have configured your project's [`outputDir`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-output-dir) option to be different than the default, you must set the `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` environment variable to the same value. This ensures that the Chromatic can find the archives generated by Playwright tests. |

---

## Viewports

Chromatic will capture the DOM and take snapshots at each viewport size a test is configured to run in.

[Viewports in Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation#viewport) can be configured globally in you main playwright config file as follows:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
      },
    },
    {
      name: "Mobile",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        viewport: { width: 500, height: 600 },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Or at the test level:

```javascript
test.use({
  viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 },
});

test("my test", async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

## Working in Monorepos

Often, when using a monorepo, developers tend to keep their e2e tests in a subdirectory instead of in the root of the project. At the same time, the Storybook and Chromatic configuration details live at the projectâ€™s root. In these cases, you will need to update the `archive-storybook` and `build-archive-storybook` scripts in your `package.json` by setting the [`-c` flag](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/cli-options#build) and `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` environment variable. For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "archive-storybook": "CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION=path/to/test-results archive-storybook -c path/to/node_modules/@chromaui/archive-storybook/config",
  "build-archive-storybook": "CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION=path/to/test-results build-archive-storybook -c path/to/node_modules/@chromaui/archive-storybook/config"
}
```

## Sharded Playwright Runs

When running your Playwright tests over multiple shared CI jobs, youâ€™ll need to wait for all jobs to complete, ensure you save the results in `./test-archives` to be accessible by the next job (for instance using an [artifact in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)), and run Chromatic in a job that depends on all of the shards.

For GitHub actions, that might look like:

```yaml
test:
  name: Run Playwright
  needs: install
  strategy:
    matrix:
      shard: [1, 2]
  steps:
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ strategy.job-total }}

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: playwright-report-${{ matrix.shard }}_${{ strategy.job-total }}
        path: ./test-archives/latest
        retention-days: 30

chromatic:
  name: Run Chromatic
  needs: test
  steps:
    - name: Download all workflow run artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3

    - name: Publish E2E Archives to Chromatic
      uses: chromaui/action@v1
      with:
        projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
        buildScriptName: build-archive-storybook
```
