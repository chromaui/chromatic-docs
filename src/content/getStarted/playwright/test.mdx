# Run visual tests with Playwright

Visual Tests are used to detect UI bugs down to the pixel. They capture a [snapshot](/docs/snapshots) of every Playwright test in a cloud browser environment. Whenever you push code, Chromatic generates a new set of snapshots and compares them against [baseline snapshots](/docs/branching-and-baselines#whats-a-baseline). If there are changes, you verify that they’re intentional. If there are test errors, you get notified to fix them.

<summary>How is this different than Playwright's visual comparisons feature?</summary>

Playwright provides visual comparison and snapshot testing features that enable you to take screenshots of web pages during a test run. These snapshots can then be compared to baseline images to detect any unexpected visual regressions.

However, the screenshots are captured on a local machine and then committed to your repo. This approach can lead to issues when collaborating with other developers on the same tests, as variations in devices such as installed fonts could result in unnecessary image discrepancies.

Chromatic, on the other hand, takes snapshots in the cloud, not locally. The DOM is captured and sent to Chromatic’s cloud, where it is then visually snapshotted in a controlled environment with consistently-versioned browsers to prevent false positives. Both DOM and snapshots are inspectable in Chromatic to make debugging quick and easy.

The snapshot files live on Chromatic’s servers so you’re not managing hundreds of megabytes of images in your repo. This is a big deal because it’s not uncommon for teams to have thousands of snapshots. If you visual test locally, you have to wait for git to sync all of those images every time you pull.

Chromatic also offers an advanced diff checker that highlights the differences between the baseline and the new snapshot, making it easy to spot visual regressions.

## PR check for “UI Tests”

Chromatic reports the status of Playwright visual tests through the ‘UI Tests’ pull request check. The badge shows errors or changes that need to be reviewed. Require the check in [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#post-the-build-status-to-a-commit), or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge-856691474.html) to prevent accidental UI bugs from being merged.
