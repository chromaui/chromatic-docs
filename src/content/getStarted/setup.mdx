# Setup and publish Storybook

The Chromatic CLI builds then publishes Storybook to a secure workspace in the cloud. That allows your team to access all your stories at [chromatic.com](https://www.chromatic.com/start).

![Publish Storybook](../../images/workflow-publish.png)

## Sign up

Before publishing, generate a unique project token for your Storybook by signing in to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/start) and creating a project. Sign in with your GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or email.

<summary id="demo-chromatic-unlinked">How to continue setup if you require SSO, on-premises, or have a different Git provider.</summary>

These instructions will teach you how to setup Chromatic with an ["unlinked" project](/docs/access#unlinked-projects). This can be useful in these situations:

- You need an enterprise plan but want to trial Chromatic in your project first
- You use an OAuth provider that we don't support right now
- You use Git hosting that we don't support right now

Start by signing in using your _personal_ account via any of the supported providers. We'll use this to authenticate you as a user only so the account doesn't have to be associated with your work.

Select "Create a project" and type your project name to create an unlinked project.

![Setup unlinked project](../../images/chromatic-setup-unlinked-project.png)

Nice! You created an unlinked project. This will allow you to get started with [UI Testing](/docs/test) workflow regardless of the underlying git provider. You can then configure your CI system to automatically run a Chromatic build on push.

The Chromatic CLI provides the option to generate a JUnit XML report of your build, which you can use to handle commit / pull request statuses yourself. See [debug options](/docs/cli#debug-options) for details.

Unlinked projects have certain drawbacks:

- You won't get automatic PR checks, so pull requests will not be marked with our status messages. You'll need to set this up manually via your CI provider.
- You won't have access to our UI Review workflow, because it relies on retrieving pull requests from your Git provider.
- Authentication and access control must be handled manually through user invites.

Now continue setting up Chromatic [as usual](/docs/setup#install).

## Install

Install the [**chromatic**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromatic) package from npm.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev chromatic
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn add --dev chromatic
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div class="aside">Storybook 6.5 or later is required. We also guarantee support for Node 14.18.x through Node 16.19.1. Other Node releases may encounter errors. To switch between Node versions, we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tj/n">n</a>, or another version manager.</div>

<details>
<summary>Learn how to add <code>chromatic</code> to your package.json</summary>

The `chromatic` command will also give you the option of adding an npm script to your `package.json` so you can run future builds with `npm run chromatic/yarn chromatic`. If you want to add it manually, it should look something like:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "chromatic": "chromatic"
  }
}
```

The above script command will pick up your project token by reading the `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` environment variable. After adding the above, ensure you set `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` when you run builds - such as in your CI config.

If you allowed `chromatic` to add the above line, it will also have written the environment variable to your `package.json`. This environment variable can also be set via your CI config for extra privacy.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Setup .gitignore to ignore certain files in your Git repository</summary>

Running the Chromatic command may generate certain files for logging and debugging purposes. Exactly which files it generates depends on your configuration, but these entries should likely be added to your `.gitignore` file:

```
build-storybook.log
chromatic.log
chromatic-build-*.xml
chromatic-diagnostics.json
```

</details>

## Run Chromatic

Once you installed the `chromatic` package and have a project token, run the following command in your project directory.

```shell
npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-token>
```

<div class="aside">
We use the <code>build-storybook</code> script from your <code>package.json</code> by default. If you have customized the <code>storybook</code> script (for example, adding a static directory with <code>-s</code>), check that you've done the same for <code>build-storybook</code>.
</div>

When complete, you'll see the build status and a link to the published Storybook:

```shell
Build 1 published.

View it online at https://www.chromatic.com/build?appId=...&number=1.
```

## View published Storybook

You published Storybook online! Every time you run the `chromatic` command you get a corresponding build in Chromatic's web app. You can now browse components, view [**UI Tests**](/docs/test) results (if enabled), and navigate to associated PR/MRs for [**UI Review**](/docs/review).

![Build for publish](../../images/build-publish-only.png)

## Get the PR check

Chromatic posts a "Storybook Publish" status check in your pull/merge request that links to the latest published Storybook. This gives teams secure, convenient access to browse components and stories. Get the PR check by [automating Chromatic with CI](/docs/ci).

<div class="aside">During setup we recommend running <code>chromatic</code> on the command line to make sure the configuration is correct. For production use run Chromatic in CI.</div>

## Next: Catch UI bugs

ðŸ“¸ Now that you published Storybook, let's see how to automate [UI Tests](/docs/test) to catch bugs.

<details>
<summary><h3 class="no-anchor">Command options</h3></summary>

If you have customized the way your Storybook runs, you may need to pass additional options to the `chromatic` command. Learn more in the [package documentation](https://github.com/chromaui/chromatic-cli#main-options).

</details>

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Chromatic doesn't work with my custom Storybook script</summary>

We do our best to interpret your Storybook script in package.json, but you might need to pass additional options to the `chromatic` command. [Check out all the options Â»](/docs/cli)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Command error <code>git log -n 1</code></summary>

This error often appears when `git` is not available in your CI environment. Chromatic uses `git` to associate commits to pull/merge requests and set baselines. We require that an executable git is available (on the `$PATH` ) of the `chromatic` script.

**Common cases:**

- Docker containers: Git may not be installed on certain Docker containers. You'll need to make the image includes Git.
- Heroku CI: Git history isn't available by default. You'll have to give Heroku auth access to your repo so that it can clone it before running CI. This can be unideal. Some customers end up using other CI providers to run Chromatic like GitHub Actions (free) or CircleCI.
- Google Cloud CI: The `.git` folder is ignored by default. Based on [their documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders/issues/236#issuecomment-374629200) you can try `.gcloudignore`. However, some customers have run into trouble with this solution and instead opted to use other CI providers to run Chromatic like GitHub Actions (free) or CircleCI.
- You don't use Git: Enable Git version control in your project and try Chromatic again.

**Debug yourself:**

- Try running the command manually `git log -n 1 --format="%H,%ct,%ce,%cn"` and check if there are errors

<summary>Why do I get errored builds randomly?</summary>

Chromatic builds and runs Storybook flawlessly _most of the time_, but we're not perfect (we wish). Sometimes builds don't run due to rare infrastructure issues. If this happens, try to re-run the build via your CI provider. We keep track of these errors to improve the service.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do my builds timeout</summary>

Chromatic takes snapshots very quickly. However, if we lose the connection to your server (for instance if you stop your server mid-build, or your internet connection goes down), builds can time out. Check your connection and try restarting the build.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is my build failing with the message <code>Cannot run a build with no stories</code>?</summary>

This happens if certain stories were disabled via the [`chromatic: { disable: true }`](/docs/ignoring-elements#ignore-stories) option at a higher level.

To solve this you can:

1. Remove the top-level [`chromatic: { disable: true }`](/docs/ignoring-elements#ignore-stories) option
1. Enable snapshots for specific stories
1. Run `yarn storybook-build` locally and fix the issues in your stories
