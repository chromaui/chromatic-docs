# Sharded Playwright Runs

When running your Playwright tests over multiple shared CI jobs, you'll need to wait for all jobs to complete, ensuring the results are saved in either the default test results directory or a custom directory accessible by the next job as artifacts. You can then run Chromatic in a job that depends on all the shards.

## GitHub Actions

If you're working with GitHub Actions, you can configure a job [matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs) to run Playwright tests in parallel across multiple instances. Enabling this option will run a separate job for every combination of the provided values, merge the test results as a single artifact, and make them available to the Chromatic job when it runs.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/chromatic.yml"
name: "UI Tests"

on: push

jobs:
  playwright:
    name: Run Playwright
    strategy:
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22.17.0
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ strategy.job-total }}
        env:
          HOME: /root
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:

          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22.17.0
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

          playwright: true
```

## GitLab Pipelines

To run Playwright tests in parallel across shared CI jobs in GitLab, you can use the [`parallel`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#parallel) option in your GitLab CI workflow. The job will be split into multiple smaller jobs running in parallel sequentially named based on the values of the environment variables. The results will be saved as an artifact and accessible by the Chromatic job when it runs.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
image: node:jod

stages:
  - UI_Tests

cache:
  key: $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG-$CI_PROJECT_DIR
  paths:
    - .npm/

before_script:
  - npm ci

Playwright:
  stage: UI_Tests
  needs: []
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble
  parallel: 2
  script:
    - npx playwright test --shard=$CI_NODE_INDEX/$CI_NODE_TOTAL
  allow_failure: true
    when: always
    paths:
      - "test-results/"
    expire_in: 4 weeks
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  needs: [Playwright]
  script:
    - npx chromatic --playwright --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
```

## CircleCI

To run Playwright tests in parallel across shared CI jobs in CircleCI, you can use the `parallelism` option in your CircleCI workflow to set the number of parallel jobs to run. You'll also need to override the default parallelization environment variables to allow the Playwright test runner to split the tests across the instances. When finished, the test results will be saved as an artifact and accessible by the Chromatic job when it runs.

```yaml title=".circleci/config.yml"
version: 2.1

executors:
  pw-noble-development:
    docker:
      - image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble
  chromatic-ui-testing:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:22.17.0

jobs:
  Playwright:
    executor: pw-noble-development
    parallelism: 2
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          name: Restore NPM cache
          keys:
            - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
            - v1-dependencies-
      - run:
          name: "Install Playwright dependencies"
          command: npm ci
      - run:
          name: "Run Playwright tests"
          command: SHARD="$((${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}+1))"; npx playwright test --shard=${SHARD}/${CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL}
          when: always
      - store_artifacts:
          path: ./test-results
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: .
          paths:
            - test-results
  Chromatic:
    executor: chromatic-ui-testing
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          name: Restore NPM cache
          keys:
            - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
            - v1-dependencies-
      - run: npm ci
      - attach_workspace:
          at: .
      - run:
          name: "Run Chromatic"
          command: npx chromatic --playwright --project-token=${CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN}
workflows:
  UI_Tests:
    jobs:
      - Playwright
      - Chromatic:
          requires:
            - Playwright
```

## Jenkins

If you're working with Jenkins, you can configure your pipeline to run Playwright tests in parallel, distributed across multiple stages, save the test results as artifacts, and run Chromatic in a separate stage that depends on the test results from the previous job.

```groovy title="Jenkinsfile"
pipeline {
  agent any
  tools {nodejs "node"}

  stages {
    stage('Install dependencies') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm ci'
      }
    }
     stage('Playwright'){
      environment {
        MAX_SHARDS = '2'
      }
      parallel {
        stage('Shard #1') {
          agent {
            docker {
              image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble'
              reuseNode true
            }
          }
          environment {
            SHARD = '1'
          }
          steps {
            sh 'npm ci'
            sh "npx playwright test --shard=${SHARD}/${env.MAX_SHARDS}"
          }
          post {
            always {
              archiveArtifacts 'test-results/**'
            }
          }
        }
        stage('Shard #2') {
          agent {
            docker {
              image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble'
              reuseNode true
            }
          }
          environment {
            SHARD = '2'
          }
          steps {
            sh 'npm ci'
            sh "npx playwright test --shard=${SHARD}/${env.MAX_SHARDS}"
          }
          post {
            always {
              archiveArtifacts 'test-results/**'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Chromatic') {
      environment {
        CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN = credentials('chromatic-project-token')
      }
      steps {
        sh "npx chromatic --playwright"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Semaphore

To run Playwright tests in parallel across shared CI jobs in Semaphore, you can use the [`parallelism`](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/pipeline-yaml#parallelism-in-jobs) option in your workflow. The job will be split into multiple smaller jobs running in parallel sequentially named based on the values of the environment variables. The results will be saved as an artifact and accessible by the Chromatic job when it runs.

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: UI Tests
agent:
  machine:
    type: e2-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2204

global_job_config:
  prologue:
    commands:
      - checkout

blocks:
  - name: Playwright
    dependencies: []
    task:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e2-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu2204
        containers:
          - name: Plawyright
            image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble
      jobs:
        - name: Run Playwright
          commands:
            - cache restore npm-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum package-lock.json)-$(checksum .semaphore/semaphore.yml)
            - npm ci
            - cache store npm-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum package-lock.json)-$(checksum .semaphore/semaphore.yml) ~/.npm
            - npx playwright test --shard=$SEMAPHORE_JOB_INDEX/$SEMAPHORE_JOB_COUNT
          parallelism: 2
      epilogue:
        always:
          commands:
            - artifact push workflow --force test-results
  - name: Run Chromatic
    dependencies: ["Playwright"]
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - artifact pull workflow test-results
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
      jobs:
        - name: Chromatic
          commands:
            - cache restore npm-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum package-lock.json)-$(checksum .semaphore/semaphore.yml)
            - npm ci
            - npx chromatic --playwright
```

## Other CI providers

If you’re using a different CI provider, you’ll need to adapt your workflow to run Playwright tests in parallel across shared CI jobs and enable Chromatic to run after all instances have finished. Here’s an example of how you might do this in a generic CI provider.

```yml title="your-workflow.yml"
image: node:jod

- run:
    name: "Playwright"
    displayName: "Run Playwright tests"
    container: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.1-noble
    options:
      parallel: 2
      artifacts:
        - test-results/**
    command: npx playwright test --shard=$CI_JOB_INDEX/CI_TOTAL_JOBS
- run:
    name: "Chromatic"
    displayName: "Run Chromatic"
    requires: [Playwright]
    command: npx chromatic --playwright --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
```
