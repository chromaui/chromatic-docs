# Support

The fastest way to get help is to search the docs and browse our [FAQ](/docs/FAQ).

Our team is spread across timezones for a quick turnaround time. Use our **in-app chat** to get in touch, but please note that responses may not be immediate as chat is asynchronous rather than real-time. Please provide details like version numbers, logs, and screenshots, to speed up troubleshooting.

Go to our [Status page](https://status.chromatic.com/) to check uptime and get updates on outages.

If your question requires more context, contact us via [email](mailto:support@chromatic.com). We recommend using email as a last resort because it can take more time to respond.
