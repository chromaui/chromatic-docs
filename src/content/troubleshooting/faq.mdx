## Comparison with other tools

<details>
<summary>How is this compared to end-to-end testing tools like Playwright and Cypress?</summary>

Chromatic complements your existing end-to-end tests in Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium.

End-to-end tests verify user flows like ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù or ‚Äúsign up‚Äù. They drive the browser to different pages of a running app and assert functionality. Teams use them in moderation to test the most critical user flows because they can be time-consuming to run.

Visual tests with Chromatic run alongside E2E tests to ensure flows look correct. Chromatic offers time-saving integrations for [Playwright](https://www.chromatic.com/playwright) and [Cypress](https://www.chromatic.com/cypress).

#### Using Storybook?

With Storybook, you already write stories as a natural part of UI development. Chromatic transforms these stories into visual tests. That gives you expansive UI coverage without having to write tests.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get rid of my BrowserStack or Sauce subscription?</summary>

Our aim isn‚Äôt to replace services like Browserstack or Sauce. Cloud browser services are invaluable for verifying interactive behavior (e.g., clicking around the UI) and end-to-end testing but aren‚Äôt built or priced for visual testing.

Chromatic gives professional UI engineers a purpose-built service for visual testing which helps you reduce your reliance on cloud browser services. In practice, our customers typically scale back their usage and save a boatload of money while increasing their testing productivity.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is Chromatic different from visual testing tools like Applitools and Percy?</summary>

Chromatic is a faster, easier to use, and cost-effective alternative to Applitools or Percy that is built for UI components and component libraries. Our customers compare us favorably on developer experience and price.

**Product differentiation**:

- Components are first-class citizens in Chromatic so our workflow is necessarily different

- Deep integration with Storybook (we're core maintainers)

- Track each components baselines through branches and merges

- Generate a living component library online

- Rewind component history

- Review components one at a time, approvals carry over from build to build

**We're proud of our developer experience:**

- "It just works" -- sensible defaults out of the box, no writing webdriver tests or custom integrations

- Lightning fast test runs (modern cloud architecture) with no cap on concurrency

- Automatic PR badging for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I already publish Storybook using S3, Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel?</summary>

You don't need to do this anymore. Chromatic is a Storybook-optimized cloud service for frontend teams that includes collaboration, access control, versioning, history, and integrations with your existing tools. That said, we're happy customers of those hosting services and recommend them for other situations.

</details>

## Usage

<details>
<summary>How is UI Review different from UI Tests? How do I get the best functionality out of both?</summary>

In a nutshell, [**UI Tests**](/docs/test) prevent regressions (bugs), while [**UI Review**](/docs/review) is for gathering qualitative feedback from your team.

The modern development process moves quickly, and developers often fill in gaps according to their best guess. UI review is an opportunity for developers to sync with other teammates to get a final OK before shipping.

Here's how we recommend using the workflows together:

- **UI Tests (commit vs. commit):** Use like unit tests to catch UI regressions in components. Typically, a developer would be responsible for this. It ensures you don't introduce any bugs as you build new features. You'll get notified of bugs down to the commit.
- **UI Review (branch vs. branch):** Once you've finished the first iteration of the implementation and think the PR is "done", it's now ready for review from stakeholders like your tech lead, designer, or PM. This workflow helps them review all the changes in a PR at once and gives them tools to give you precise feedback on stories.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I only take snapshots when a component's code changes?</summary>

We recommend taking snapshots on every build because it's the most reliable way to catch UI regressions. Global dependencies, such as CSS or third-party APIs can affect the UI without the code changing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when I run out of snapshots on the free plan?</summary>

Free plans come with 5000 snapshots per month. Once free snapshots are exhausted, testing & review will become paused until the next month at which time Chromatic will again begin taking snapshots and functionality will automatically resume. Upgrading to a paid plan will immediately resume testing & review.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens to my snapshots if I don't use them?</summary>

Chromatic will reset the snapshot count monthly, calculated based on the day you've signed up. For instance, if you signed up on February 14th, your count will be reset on the 14th of each month. Any remaining snapshots from the previous month will not accumulate.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where can I find my project token?</summary>

The project token is available on the Manage ‚Üí Configure page of your project.

![Navigate to the Manage page and click on the Configure tab](../../images/configure-project-token.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I reset or cycle my project token?</summary>

Users with the [`owner`](/docs/collaborators#roles) role can reset or cycle project tokens on the Configure page of your project.

![Navigate to the Manage page and click on the Configure tab](../../images/reset-project-token.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are the story names in Chromatic different than what I have in Storybook?</summary>

Chromatic follows Storybook's [naming best practice](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy). The last level in the hierarchy is tracked as the component name.

```js
// Button.stories.js|jsx

import { Button } from "./Button";

export default {
  title: "App/Components/Button",
  component: Button,
};

/*
 *üëá Render functions are a framework-specific feature to allow you control over how the component renders.
 * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf
 * to learn how to use render functions.
 */
export const Primary = {
  render: () => <Button primary>Button</Button>,
};

export const Secondary = {
  render: () => <Button secondary>Button</Button>,
};
```

In the example above, `Button` is the component name, while `Primary` and `Secondary` are the story names respectively. If your Storybook is organized in a different way, that will affect how your components and story names appear in both Chromatic and Storybook. There's no way to configure name detection.

Folks often encounter naming issues when customizing their Storybook sidebar. In most cases, you can achieve your desired groupings while also adhering to naming best practices using these [organizational tips](https://storybook.js.org/blog/structuring-your-storybook/).

### Browsers

<details>
<summary>Can I disable Chrome?</summary>

All plans use Chrome by default because it offers the greatest test coverage for most people. It cannot be disabled.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I change which browser generates comparisons for UI Review?</summary>

No. At the moment, Chrome is fixed as the browser used for UI review.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do browsers affect my snapshot count?</summary>

Each browser adds another snapshot for each of your stories. For example, if you have a story that is tested in Chrome and Safari, that counts as two snapshots.

If you also test your story with different viewports, those count as snapshots as well. For example, you want to test a story at `320px`, `1280px`, `Chrome`, and `Safari`. This would count as 4 snapshots.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does adding more browser coverage add time to my tests?</summary>

Yes it can. We do our best to provide the fastest test speeds but there are limits to browser performance even when scaled across hundreds and thousands of machines.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What about testing in every other browser and its versions?</summary>

Chromatic covers the major rendering engines (Blink, Gecko and Webkit) at all viewports. This eliminates almost all browser regressions your users are likely to see with minimal effort, configuration, or additional time to your workflow.

Supporting more browser/device combinations ends up having diminishing returns that adds noise to the visual testing process.

</details>

### UI Tests and UI Review

<details>
<summary>Do I use more snapshots when both UI Tests and UI Review are enabled?</summary>

No. Snapshots taken for one workflow are reused for the other. You don't get charged twice.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I disable UI Tests and/or UI Review?</summary>

As long as either the testing or review features are enabled, Chromatic will continue taking snapshots. With both disabled, Chromatic will stop taking snapshots and all other features of the platform (such as publishing) will continue without limits.

</details>

### Publish

<details>
<summary>Why is my Storybook failing to load in Chromatic's Canvas tab?</summary>

**Mixed content**

<br />
If your stories make use of non-HTTPS content (for instance, images), the iframe
rendering your stories will fail to load, as modern browsers do not allow [mixed
content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) (HTTP
content sources included within HTTPS pages).

To fix this, ensure all resources used by your stories are served via HTTPS.

**CORS violation**

<br />
Chromatic renders your published stories in an iframe. Due to browser security restrictions,
your components and stories cannot reference `window.parent` or `window.top`. In
Storybook, those properties would reference the Storybook manager interface, which
is located on the same domain as the iframe and therefore allowed. But when rendered
on chromatic.com, those properties would reference a different (sub)domain and therefore
violate CORS restrictions, causing a JavaScript error. There are three ways to mitigate
this issue:

1. Don‚Äôt reference `window.parent` or `window.top`. If you‚Äôre trying to communicate with the Storybook manager UI, it‚Äôs better to use ‚Äúchannels.‚Äù Storybook provides the [useChannel API](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addons-api#usechannel) for this purpose.

2. Conditionally avoid `window.parent` and `window.top` by checking `isChromatic()`. We provide the [`isChromatic` utility](/docs/ischromatic) to ‚Äúdetect‚Äù when a story is rendered inside of Chromatic.

3. Wrap your `window.parent` and `window.top` references in a `try/catch` block. This will suppress the JavaScript error.

</details>

### Continuous Integration

<details>
<summary>How to run Chromatic on a specific branch or only when merging to main?</summary>

How Chromatic is triggered depends on your Continuous Integration (CI) setup. You can configure your CI provider to run Chromatic on a specific branch or only when merging to your main branch. Please beware that changing which branches Chromatic runs on may affect test and review coverage because Chromatic uses Git history to [track baselines](/docs/branching-and-baselines).

For example, here‚Äôs how GitHub Actions can be configured:

- [Using filters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#using-filters)
- [Using conditions to control job execution](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-conditions-to-control-job-execution)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't the Chromatic CLI find git during CI?</summary>

Pipeline configurations allow you to specify the docker image that you'd like to use for your runners. To keep the image size small, lots of `*-slim` images do not come with git installed which Chromatic CLI requires to link builds to commits.

To solve this you can install git as a step before running the Chromatic CLI or change your image to something that includes git.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't Chromatic find my ancestor build during CI?</summary>

This problem can arise when your project's git history is altered during CI.

For example, we have found some community GitHub actions such as `tj-actions/changed-files` that alters git history in order to determine which files have been changed.

In this instance, we found that checking out your repository again after running `tj-actions/changed-files` again resolves the issue.

Your steps should look something like this

```
Checkout
tj-actions/changed-files
Checkout
Chromatic
```

</details>

### TurboSnap

<details>
<summary>Why isn‚Äôt TurboSnap working for me?</summary>

You may be missing one of the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/setup-turbosnap#prerequisites). For [debugging information](/docs/setup-turbosnap#verify-that-turbosnap-is-working) check your CI build logs.

</details>

### Storybook Connect Figma plugin

<details>
<summary>Can you choose which version of the design from a Storybook is shown in Figma?</summary>

Yes, you can select which branch's stories are connected to Figma.

Chromatic generates a unique permalink when a Storybook is published. You can link your component by using the URL to a specific commit or a [permalink](/docs/permalinks#build-your-own-permalink) to a branch.

However, once linked, the plugin will always display stories from the latest build for that branch.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does the Figma integration sync automatically?</summary>

Yes. Chromatic automatically updates your linked stories to reflect the latest build on the designated branch. That means even when the build URL for a branch changes in Chromatic, the Figma component will always display the latest build on the branch.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do permissions work?</summary>

Figma users must have access to the Chromatic project in order to use the plugin. That means Figma collaborators (viewers, editors, admins) that have access to your Figma file but don't have access to Chromatic will not be able to see the stories.

Learn how to invite teammates as [collaborators](/docs/collaborators) on your Chromatic project. We don't charge "per seat", so you can invite your whole team.
They must be able to see the story in Chromatic to be able to see it in the plugin.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What permissions do I need in Figma?</summary>

You require a Figma `editor` role to both link and view stories with this plugin.

</details>

## Compatibility

<details>
<summary>Does Chromatic work with Azure DevOps?</summary>

Chromatic is a CI-powered service. That means you can run `chromatic` in any CI workflow including Azure DevOps. However, some of the automatic configuration that comes out of the box from Chromatic won't be available to Azure DevOps users. Rest assured, it's straightforward to configure yourself. Below are things to note for set up:

- Your team must sign up via [email/password](/docs/access#email)
- Access control is manually-managed at the project level via [External Collaborators](/docs/collaborators#external-collaborators)
- Pull request checks must be setup via in your [CI provider](/docs/ci#pull-request-checks)

Read the [setup guide](/docs/faq#demo-chromatic-unlinked).
