# Using and understanding Chromatic JUnit report

You can generate a JUnit XML report by setting the flag `junitReport` when you run Chromatic. This report is a valuable artifact that you can store and use for advanced reporting and monitoring purposes.

## Report Structure and Key Data

The Chromatic JUnit report is an XML file that summarizes the results of a build. The root `<testsuite>` tag contains high-level information about the entire test run. Key properties in every report include:

- `buildNumber`: The Chromatic build number.
- `buildUrl`: A direct link to the build results in the Chromatic UI.
- `storybookUrl`: A link to your published Storybook.
- `tests`: The total count of stories tested.
- `failures`: The number of stories with visual changes that need review.
- `skipped`: The number of stories that were skipped.
- `errors`: The count of stories that encountered an error.

Here's an example from a report file:

```xml title="chromatic-build-159.xml"
<testsuite name="Chromatic build 159" ... tests="86" failures="1" errors="0" skipped="0">
    <properties>
      <property name="buildNumber" value="159"/>
      <property name="buildStatus" value="PENDING"/>
      <property name="buildUrl" value="https://www.chromatic.com/build?appId=...&amp;number=159"/>
      <property name="storybookUrl" value="https://...-nxjzlatrta.chromatic.com/"/>
    </properties>
</testsuite>
```

## Understanding Test Statuses

Each `<testcase>` within the report represents a single Storybook story. Its status is indicated by the presence of child tags like `<failure>` or `<skipped>`.

### Changed Stories

If a story has visual changes that require review, it is marked with a `<failure>` tag.

```xml title="chromatic-build-159.xml"
<testcase classname="Atoms.Loader" name="Shadow Dom">
  <properties>
    <property name="result" value="PENDING" />
  </properties>
  <failure
    message="Snapshot contains visual changes and must be reviewed"
    type="PENDING"
  />
</testcase>
```

<div class="callout">
  If a story with changes in one build is run again in a subsequent build
  without being reviewed, it will still be flagged as "changed".
</div>

### Skipped Stories

Stories that are skipped during the build are explicitly marked with a `<skipped/>` tag.

```xml title="chromatic-build-159.xml"
<testcase classname="Atoms.Loader" name="Shadow Dom">
  <properties>
    <property name="result" value="PENDING" />
  </properties>
  <failure
    message="Snapshot contains visual changes and must be reviewed"
    type="PENDING"
  />
</testcase>
```

### Passed and Disabled Stories

A story that has passed successfully will appear as a simple `<testcase>` with no child tags.

Stories that you've disabled in your Storybook configuration (`disabledSnapshot: true`) will still be listed in the report but will not be flagged with `<skipped/>`.

## Storing the Report as an Artifact

First, ensure you're saving the report in your CI environment. In GitHub Actions, you can use the `actions/upload-artifact` job. The report file typically follows the naming pattern `chromatic-build-*.xml`.

```yml title=".github/workflows/chromatic.yml"
- name: Upload Build Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: chromatic-reports
    path: chromatic-build-*.xml
```

Once you have the XML file, you can write a script in your CI pipeline to:

1. **Parse the XML file:** Extract key attributes from the `<testsuite>` and `<testcase>` elements.
2. **Format the data:** Convert the extracted information into a JSON payload suitable for your monitoring tool's API.
3. **Send the data**: Push the JSON payload to an endpoint provided by tools like Datadog, New Relic, or a custom analytics solution.

### Datadog

The most straightforward method for sending your JUnit reports to Datadog is by using the `datadog-ci` command-line tool or its corresponding GitHub Action.


1. Install the `datadog-ci` CLI
2. After your tests have run and generated the JUnit XML report, use the following command:

```shell
datadog-ci junit upload --service chromatic <path-to-your-junit-xml-files>
```

You will need to configure your Datadog API and application keys as environment variables (`DD_API_KEY` and `DD_APP_KEY`).

GitHub Action

For workflows hosted on GitHub Actions, you can use the [`datadog/junit-upload-github-action`](https://github.com/DataDog/junit-upload-github-action):

```yml title=".github/workflows/test.yml"
- name: Upload test results to Datadog
  uses: datadog/junit-upload-github-action@v1
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.DD_API_KEY }}
    junit_files: "target/surefire-reports/*.xml"
    service: "your-service-name"
```
