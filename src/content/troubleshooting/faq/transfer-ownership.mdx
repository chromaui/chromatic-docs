# How do I transfer account ownership to another user?

To transfer ownership, you will need to assign another collaborator with the owner role - please note they must be a collaborator within the organization account (via Git provider). If you have an individual account and want to transfer it to another user, please reach out to us using our **in-app chat** or email us at **support@chromatic.com**.
