# How do I get the published Storybook output URL through the CI pipeline?

1. Add the `--diagnostics` flag to your Chromatic command/script to generate the `chromatic-diagnostics.json` file.
2. Store the diagnostics file as a **CI artifact**, which should let you reference the JSON output and obtain the URL and other outputs needed.
Refer to: [GitHub artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts), [GitLab artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_artifacts.html), [BitBucket artifacts](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-artifacts-in-steps/), [CircleCI artifacts](https://circleci.com/docs/artifacts/), [TravisCI artifacts](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/uploading-artifacts/) and [Jenkins artifacts](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/tests-and-artifacts/)
3. Find the Storybook URL under `storybookUrl` and the Chromatic build URL under `webUrl` in the `chromatic-diagnostics.json` file.
