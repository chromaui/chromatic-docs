# Why is the 'Snapshot' different from the 'Canvas'?

The `Canvas` is an interactive environment where you can see the real component code in action, and reproduce its behavior. It shows how Storybook renders on Chromatic, displaying the component in its *final state*. 

The `Snapshot` refers to the image captured by Chromatic's cloud browser, which represents what the browser **saw** at the time it rendered the story. 

This could be the component's *initial* or *intermediate* state, and it might differ from the `Canvas` due to various reasons, such as JavaScript execution being blocked during capture, which can prevent certain elements from being captured, or the use of the `isChromatic()` function to alter rendering on Chromatic.
