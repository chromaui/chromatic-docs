# Why am I receiving a failed to login as OAuth user error ?

If you're encountering issues with linking your Git provider to Chromatic, one of the most common reasons for this error is due to existing duplicate accounts.

The first step in resolving this issue is identifying any previous accounts you may have with Chromatic.

Once you've identified a potential duplicate account, the next step is to log into Chromatic using the account that's causing the issue.

If you are unable to find the account, please contact support via our **in-app chat** or email us at **support@chromatic.com** so we can assist you further.
