# Why can't Chromatic find an ancestor build during CI?

This problem can arise when your project's git history is altered during CI.

For example, we have found some community GitHub actions such as `tj-actions/changed-files` that alters git history in order to determine which files have been changed.

In this instance, we found that checking out your repository again after running `tj-actions/changed-files` again resolves the issue.

Your steps should look something like this

```
Checkout
tj-actions/changed-files
Checkout
Chromatic
```
