# Can I use BDD with Playwright?

Testing with Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is not supported by default with the Playwright integration, and you'll have to rely on a third-party integration such as [Playwright BDD](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd). To enable it, you'll need to adjust your [fixture](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/getting-started/add-fixtures) file to compose the Playwright BDD API with Chromatic via the [`mergeTests`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#combine-custom-fixtures-from-multiple-modules) function.

```ts title="features/steps/fixtures.ts"
import { test as chromaticTest } from "@chromatic-com/playwright";

import { test as base, createBdd } from "playwright-bdd";

import { mergeTests } from "@playwright/test";

const FIXTURES = {
  // Custom fixtures go here
} as const;

export const test = mergeTests(chromaticTest, base).extend<typeof FIXTURES>(
  FIXTURES,
);

export const { Given, When, Then } = createBdd(test);
```

## Configure Playwright BDD with Chromatic

If you need to include any of the available [configuration options](/docs/playwright/configure/) supported by Chromatic in your BDD tests, you'll need to provide a custom tag to the feature file and adjust your fixture file to override the required option as needed.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="feature">
    ```plaintext title="features/Homepage.feature"
    @noAutoSnapshot
    Feature: Homepage

      Scenario: Homepage loads
        Given I am on the homepage
        Then I see the title "Welcome"
    ```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="steps">
    ```ts title="features/steps/fixtures.ts"
    import { test as chromaticTest } from "@chromatic-com/playwright";

    import { test as base, createBdd } from "playwright-bdd";

    import { mergeTests } from "@playwright/test";

    export const test = mergeTests(chromaticTest, base).extend({
      disableAutoSnapshot: async ({ $tags }, use) => {
        await use($tags.includes('@noAutoSnapshot'));
      },
      // Add additional options here
    });

    export const { Given, When, Then } = createBdd(test);
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Enabling targeted snapshots with BDD

To enable [targeted snapshots](/docs/playwright/targeted-snapshots) with BDD, adjust your test steps file to use the `$testInfo` fixture to pass the test information to the `takeSnapshot` function allowing you to take a snapshot of the page at a specific point in the test.

```ts title="features/steps/Homepage.steps.ts"
import { expect, takeSnapshot } from "@chromatic-com/playwright";

import { Given, Then } from "./fixtures";

Given("I am on the homepage", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
});

Then("I see the title {string}", async ({ page }, keyword: string) => {
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(new RegExp(keyword));
  await takeSnapshot(page, "Page Loaded", $testInfo);
});
```
