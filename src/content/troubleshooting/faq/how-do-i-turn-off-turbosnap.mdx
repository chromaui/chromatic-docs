# How do I turn off TurboSnap?

TurboSnap is an opt-in feature. You can't configure it through the Chromatic web app. Instead, it is controlled via the CLI and CI configuration.

To turn off TurboSnap, you need to remove the `--only-changed` flag from your CLI command or the `onlyChanged` property from your CI workflow and/or `chromatic.config.json` file.
