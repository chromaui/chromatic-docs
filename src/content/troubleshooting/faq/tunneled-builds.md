# Why are my tunneled builds failing?

Running Chromatic builds via the tunnel option is no longer supported with the release of Chromatic CLI v2.0.0. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of the CLI as soon as possible to avoid any issues with your builds in the future.

If you have any questions or need help with the upgrade, please get in touch with us via our in-app chat or email us at support@chromatic.com.
