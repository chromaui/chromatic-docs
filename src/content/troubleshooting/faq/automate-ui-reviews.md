# How can I automate Ul Reviews?

Automated UI reviews in Chromatic only function when your project is linked to a Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This connection enables Chromatic to track changes, compare them against the existing codebase, and automatically detect visual differences.

Without linking to a Git provider, you will need to perform manual UI reviews: https://www.chromatic.com/docs/manual-ui-review/
