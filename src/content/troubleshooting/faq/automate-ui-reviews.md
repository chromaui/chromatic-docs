# How can I automatically trigger a UI Review?

UI Reviews are triggered automatically when your project is [linked](/docs/access#linked-projects) to a Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This connection enables Chromatic to track changes, compare them against the existing codebase, and automatically start a UI Review when a new pull/merge request is created.

Without linking to a Git provider, you will need to use the [manual UI Review](/docs/manual-ui-review/) process.
