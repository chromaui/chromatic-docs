# Do I get charged for snapshots when I rerun a build?

When you rerun a build by clicking the rerun button on the UI Test page, Chromatic only charges for snapshots taken for denied and unreviewed tests. Snapshots for accepted tests and TurboSnaps are not retaken and do not incur additional charges.
