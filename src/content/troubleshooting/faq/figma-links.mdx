# What types of Figma links does Chromatic support?

Chromatic currently only supports linking to Figma components.
Links to frames, layers, or other Figma node types aren't supported.

To connect your designs, make sure you copy the component link
from Figma `(right-click → “Copy link” on a component in your Figma file).`
