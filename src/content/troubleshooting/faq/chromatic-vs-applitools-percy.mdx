# How is Chromatic different from visual testing tools like Applitools and Percy?

Chromatic is a faster, easier to use, and cost-effective alternative to Applitools or Percy that is built for UI components and component libraries. Our customers compare us favorably on developer experience and price.

**Product differentiation**:

- Components are first-class citizens in Chromatic so our workflow is necessarily different

- Deep integration with Storybook (we're core maintainers)

- Track each components baselines through branches and merges

- Generate a living component library online

- Rewind component history

- Review components one at a time, approvals carry over from build to build

**We're proud of our developer experience:**

- "It just works" -- sensible defaults out of the box, no writing webdriver tests or custom integrations

- Lightning fast test runs (modern cloud architecture) with no cap on concurrency

- Automatic PR badging for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
