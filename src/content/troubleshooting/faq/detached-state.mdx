# Why is my build in a 'detached' state and how do I fix it?

A build can be in a "detached HEAD" state because most CI providers check out a specific commit hash rather than a branch name which means the runner doesn't inherently know which branch it's on.
Without the branch, Chromatic can't find the correct baseline to compare against.

You can tell Chromatic the branch by setting the [environment variables](/docs/faq/environment-variables) in your CI script. Note [you must set all variables](/docs/cli#chromatic-git-options).
