# Can you choose which version of the design from a Storybook is shown in Figma?

Yes, you can select which branch's stories are connected to Figma.

Chromatic generates a unique permalink when a Storybook is published. You can link your component by using the URL to a specific commit or a [permalink](/docs/permalinks#build-your-own-permalink) to a branch.

However, once linked, the plugin will always display stories from the latest build for that branch.
