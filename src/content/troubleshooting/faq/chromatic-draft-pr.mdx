# How to skip Chromatic runs for draft PRs?

Chromatic provides flags like [`--skip`](/docs/configure#skip) to bypass builds and [`--skip-update-check`](/docs/configure#skipupdatecheck) to bypass checks that might block your pipeline, but it lacks a built-in feature to automatically skip commits based on status.
You can prevent Chromatic from running on draft pull requests by adding a conditional check to your CI workflow.

Here's an example of how you might achieve that:

```yaml
name: "Chromatic"

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  chromatic:
    # This condition prevents the job from running on draft PRs
    if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # ... other steps to build your Storybook
      - name: Publish to Chromatic
        uses: chromaui/action@v1
        with:
          projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
```

Including ready_for_review in the on trigger ensures the workflow runs as soon as the PR is marked "Ready for review." If necessary, you can delete this.
