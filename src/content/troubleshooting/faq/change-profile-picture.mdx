# How can I change my profile picture?

It is possible to change the profile picture for email/password and single sign-on (SSO) accounts by using Gravatar. For users using their git provider, profile pictures are synced automatically.

To change your profile picture in [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/), you will need to do the following:
1. Create a profile with the email address used for your Chromatic account
2. Assign a profile picture, which will reflect on your Chromatic profile

**Please note**: Gravatar is a third-party service that we have no affiliation with. Currently there is no other way to change your profile picture in Chromatic.
