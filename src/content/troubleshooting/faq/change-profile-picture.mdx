# How can I change my profile picture?

It is possible to change the profile picture for email/password and single sign-on (SSO) accounts by using Gravatar. For users using their git provider, profile pictures are synced automatically.

To change your profile picture in Gravatar, you will need to do the following:

Create a profile with the email address used for your account

Assign a profile picture, which will reflect on your chromatic profile

**Please note**: Gravatar is a third-party service that we have no affiliation with. Currently there is no other way to change your profile picture in Chromatic.
