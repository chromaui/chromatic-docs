# Are there any restrictions for external collaborators?

External collaborators do not have the same permissions as collaborators linked to git providers.

1. External collaborators cannot link Chromatic projects to a git provider.

2. External collaborators cannot manage the account-level settings. e.g. Billings.

3. External collaborators cannot create new projects.

4. External collaborators have access only to the project to which they are invited. They don't have access to all projects in an account.
