# My organization restricts IP addresses for Git access. Should I add Chromatic to the allowlist?

Yes, you must add Chromatic's IP addresses to the allow list by following the instructions provided in the [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/ip_allowlist.html), and [BitBucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/control-access-to-your-private-content/#Allowlisting-IP-addresses) documentation. Below are the IP addresses you may need to allow list:
