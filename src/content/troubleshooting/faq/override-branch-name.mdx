# Override the branch name if Chromatic is unable to identify the correct one on CI

In some cases, Chromatic's automatic CI detection is unable to figure out the branch name associated with a build. You'll see a message like this in your build logs:

```bash
Removing unknown owner prefix from branch name. You may wish to set the branch directly to avoid incorrect values.
```

In this case, set the branch name directly by configuring the `CHROMATIC_SHA`, `CHROMATIC_BRANCH`, and `CHROMATIC_SLUG` environment variables. For example, in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Chromatic
  env:
    CHROMATIC_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
    CHROMATIC_BRANCH: ${{ github.ref }}
    CHROMATIC_SLUG: ${{ github.repository }}
  run: npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
```
