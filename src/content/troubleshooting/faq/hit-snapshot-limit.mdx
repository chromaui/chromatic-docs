# What happens if I exceed the snapshot limit?

Once you reach your **snapshot limit**, the outcome varies depending on your account type.

For free accounts, review and testing will be paused until your snapshot limit resets.

For paid plans, reviews and testing will continue uninterrupted, and you will be billed for any additional snapshots used within the current billing period.

Learn how to set usage alerts to prevent overages [here](/docs/billing#usage-alerts).
