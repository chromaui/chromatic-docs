# What happens if I update my plan before the end of the billing period?

If you update your paid plan before the end of the billing period and you still have unused time, we will credit you for any unused time on the current plan, and charge you for the remaining time on your new paid plan.
If you update your paid plan to a free plan mid-cycle, you will receive credit for any unused time.
If you have any further questions, please reach out to us via our **in-app chat** or email us at **support@chromatic.com**.
