# How do browsers affect my snapshot count?

Each browser adds another snapshot for each of your stories. For example, if you have a story that is tested in Chrome and Safari, that counts as two snapshots.

If you also test your story with different viewports, those count as snapshots as well. For example, you want to test a story at `320px`, `1280px`, `Chrome`, and `Safari`. This would count as 4 snapshots.
