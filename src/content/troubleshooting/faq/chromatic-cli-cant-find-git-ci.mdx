# Why can't the Chromatic CLI find git during CI?

Pipeline configurations allow you to specify the docker image that you'd like to use for your runners. To keep the image size small, lots of `*-slim` images do not come with git installed which Chromatic CLI requires to link builds to commits.

To solve this you can install git as a step before running the Chromatic CLI or change your image to something that includes git.
