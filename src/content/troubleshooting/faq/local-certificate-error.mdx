# I hit error "unable to to get local issuer certificate" when running Chromatic. How do I fix this?

The local certificate error typically is caused by your local certificate store in Mac OS, Node, or it may be due to local network settings.
Run the commands below, and reach out to support to share the output to help diagnose the issue.

```sh
curl https://index.chromatic.com/graphql -v
openssl s_client -connect index.chromatic.com:443
