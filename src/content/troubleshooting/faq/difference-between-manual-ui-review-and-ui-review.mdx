# What is the difference between a standard UI Review and a manual UI Review?

Standard UI Reviews are linked to a specific pull or merge request and are automatically triggered when you open one. These reviews are only available in [linked projects](/docs/access#linked-projects).

[Manual UI Reviews](/docs/manual-ui-review/) are not linked to a pull/merge request and must be triggered manually via the Chromatic UI. They are only available for [unlinked projects](/docs/access#unlinked-projects).

That said, both types of UI Review use the comparison mechanism.
