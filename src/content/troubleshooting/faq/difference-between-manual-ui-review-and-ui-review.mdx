# What's the difference between a standard UI Review and a manual UI Review?

[Manual UI Reviews](/docs/manual-ui-review/) are available for [unlinked projects](/docs/access/#unlinked-projects). 
[Manual UI Reviews](/docs/manual-ui-review/) are not linked to a pull/merge request and must be triggered manually via the Chromatic UI. They are only available for [unlinked projects](/docs/access/#unlinked-projects).

That said, both types of UI Review use the comparison mechanism.
