# How do I connect my Git user to my Chromatic user?

If you have an email/password user, you can link it to your Git account.

Open the Profile page: https://www.chromatic.com/profile

Below `Connect`, tab the Git provider of your choise and follow the steps on Git side to authorize Chromatic to link both users. 

To disconnect your Git user, press `Disconnect`. 

One user can be connected to more than 1 Git user.


### I hit error `Authentication error. Failed to login as OAuth user` when I try to connect my Git user

This error means the Git user already exists. If you created it by mistake, log out from the current account.

Go to the login page: https://www.chromatic.com/start

Press Connect with the Git provider of your choise and access the second account.

Open the Profile page: https://www.chromatic.com/profile

Scroll down and [remove the user](docs/faq/delete-my-profile/).

Then go back to the initial account and try to connect the Git user in the Profile page.
