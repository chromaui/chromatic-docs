# Link Git account to Chromatic account

## Link your Git account to your Chromatic account

If you registered your Chromatic account using an email and password, you can link it to a Git provider like GitHub or BitBucket.

1. Open the Profile page: https://www.chromatic.com/profile
2. Below `Connect`, tab the Git provider of your choise and follow the steps on Git side to authorize Chromatic to link both users.

You can connect to more than one Git provider.

### Error when trying to connect a Git account

If you encounter an `Authentication error: Failed to login as OAuth user` while trying to connect to a Git account, it means a Chromatic account already exists with that particular Git account. You probably created that account by mistake, so you can delete it:

1. Log out of your current account
2. Go to the login page: https://www.chromatic.com/start
3. Press Connect with the Git provider. Pick of your choice and access the second account.
4. Open the Profile page: https://www.chromatic.com/profile
5. Scroll down and [remove the user](/docs/faq/delete-my-profile/).

Then go back to the initial account and try to connect the Git account via the profile page.

## Unlink your Git account

1. Open the Profile page: https://www.chromatic.com/profile
2. Press `Disconnect`
