# Can billing be shared across multiple Chromatic accounts?

Chromatic no longer supports sharing a single self-serve paid plan across multiple accounts (for example, across different GitHub organizations). 
New self-serve subscriptions can be linked to one account only, and usage can't be combined across accounts.

For teams that need multi-account billing or consolidated usage, this capability is available through 
an Enterprise plan. Please reach out to our sales team for more information.
