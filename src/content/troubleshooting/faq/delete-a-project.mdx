# How do I delete a project?

To remove a project, you'll need to follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the project and click the `Manage` tab on the left-hand side
2. Click the `Configure` tab and scroll down to the `DANGER ZONE` (please note that once you remove a project, you will not be able to retrieve the project builds or history)
3. Click `Remove`, followed by `OK` to confirm

Please reach out to support@chromatic.com if you're encountering any issues or our in-app live chat.
