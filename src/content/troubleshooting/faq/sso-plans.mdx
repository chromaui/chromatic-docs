# Is Single Sign-on (SSO) available on the Starter or Pro plans?

No Single Sign-on (SSO) is not available on self-serve plans like Starter or Pro. It's only available on Enterprise plans.

If you're interested in SSO, contact us via in-app chat or <a href="mailto:support@chromatic.com?Subject=Custom%20plan%20with%20SSO">email</a> to discuss your requirements.
