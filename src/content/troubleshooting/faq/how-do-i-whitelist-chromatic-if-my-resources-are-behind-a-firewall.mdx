# How do I whitelist chromatic.com if my resources are behind a firewall?

To whitelist the [Chromatic.com](https://www.chromatic.com/). domain, you will need to make sure this is added to the allowed list in your firewall settings. Since [Chromatic.com](https://www.chromatic.com/) is a top-level domain, you won't need to whitelist any subdomains.
