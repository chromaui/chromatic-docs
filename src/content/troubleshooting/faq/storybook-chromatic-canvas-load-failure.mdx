# Why is my Storybook failing to load in Chromatic's Canvas tab?

## Mixed content

If your stories make use of non-HTTPS content (for instance, images), the iframe
rendering your stories will fail to load, as modern browsers do not allow [mixed
content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) (HTTP
content sources included within HTTPS pages).

To fix this, ensure all resources used by your stories are served via HTTPS.

## CORS violation

Chromatic renders your published stories in an iframe. Due to browser security restrictions,
your components and stories cannot reference `window.parent` or `window.top`. In
Storybook, those properties would reference the Storybook manager interface, which
is located on the same domain as the iframe and therefore allowed. But when rendered
on chromatic.com, those properties would reference a different (sub)domain and therefore
violate CORS restrictions, causing a JavaScript error. There are three ways to mitigate
this issue:

1. Don’t reference `window.parent` or `window.top`. If you’re trying to communicate with the Storybook manager UI, it’s better to use “channels.” Storybook provides the [useChannel API](https://storybook.js.org/docs/addons/addons-api#usechannel) for this purpose.

2. Conditionally avoid `window.parent` and `window.top` by checking `isChromatic()`. We provide the [`isChromatic` utility](/docs/ischromatic) to “detect” when a story is rendered inside of Chromatic.

3. Wrap your `window.parent` and `window.top` references in a `try/catch` block. This will suppress the JavaScript error.
