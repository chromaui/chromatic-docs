# How do I link a repository to my project?

If your repository is part of a git entity, you must get the access request approved by an admin at the organization level.

If you aren't a member of a git entity, you can't link their repositories to a Chromatic project. Please refer to our documentation on access control here: [Access control](/docs/access/#access-control)
