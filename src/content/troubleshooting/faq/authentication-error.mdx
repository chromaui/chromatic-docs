# I hit the authentication error: `Failed to login as OAuth user`

This error means that your Git account is already linked to a Chromatic user. Here are two options to resolve this:

**Option 1: Keep both users**

You can keep both the Git-linked and email/password users, but each will have its own login method in the Login page.

**Option 2: Consolidate both users**

- Log in with Git. On the Login page, select `Connect with ...` to access the Git-linked user.
- Delete the user by following the instructions provided [here](/docs/faq/delete-my-profile).
- Log back in with your email/password.
- Link Git: Go to your `Profile` settings and connect your desired Git provider.

After completing these steps, youâ€™ll have a single account that you can access with either email/password or Git.
