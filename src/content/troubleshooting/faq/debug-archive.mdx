# How to debug the Chromatic archive locally?

You should debug the archive locally if you suspect that an E2E project issue is related to the Chromatic archive **not being generated** or being generated **incorrectly**.

Debugging locally lets you see what Chromatic sends off for screenshotting. Sometimes the archive can be broken even if you don't hit an error.

1. Add the script `"archive-storybook": "archive-storybook"` to the scripts section of your project's package.json file.

2. Run your E2E tests as you normally would (using Playwright or Cypress) and then run the new script:

```bash
npm run archive-storybook
# or
yarn archive-storybook
```

3. Inspect the stories that Chromatic would upload.
