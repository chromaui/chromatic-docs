# How do I delete a build?

Deleting builds is a tricky concept for us. We've generally found that removing builds from view causes more confusion than leaving them there. Builds are used heavily in our baseline algorithms which brings complexity when deleting individual links in the chain. You are able to delete any projects (which will delete all builds) and their accounts through your dashboard. If you require support in doing this, please use our **in-app chat** to get in touch with us, or email us at **support@chromatic.com**.
