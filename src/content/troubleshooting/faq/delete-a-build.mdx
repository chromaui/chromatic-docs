# How do I delete a build?

Builds are used heavily in our baseline algorithms which brings complexity when deleting individual links in the chain. We've found that removing builds from view causes more confusion than leaving them there. You are able to delete any projects (which will delete all builds) and their accounts through your dashboard. If you require support in doing this, please use our **in-app chat** to get in touch with us, or email us at **support@chromatic.com**.
