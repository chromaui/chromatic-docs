# Why can't I see the 1up/2up feature in Chromatic?

If you’re unable to see the 1up/2up feature, it's likely because there’s no baseline snapshot to compare against.
In order to use the 1up/2up feature, a baseline needs to be established first.
To resolve this, please review and approve the current snapshot as it appears on your end, then create a new baseline.
Once the new baseline is created, the 1up/2up feature will be available for comparison.
