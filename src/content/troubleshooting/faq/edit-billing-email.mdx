# How can I edit my billing email?

Chromatic sets the account's billing email address to the email address of the person who signed up to the plan. Chromatic will send all billing and account-related emails to this address while continuing to send in-app notifications to the relevant person's email address. To edit your billing email, please do the following:

1. Navigate to the `billing` tab in the sidebar of your account.

2. Select `Change email`
