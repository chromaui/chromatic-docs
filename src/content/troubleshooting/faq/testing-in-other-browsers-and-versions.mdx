# What about testing in every other browser and its versions?

Chromatic covers the major rendering engines (Blink, Gecko and Webkit) at all viewports. This eliminates almost all browser regressions your users are likely to see with minimal effort, configuration, or additional time to your workflow.

Supporting more browser/device combinations ends up having diminishing returns that adds noise to the visual testing process.
