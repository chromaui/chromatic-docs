# Can I use a Storybook build in development mode to build Chromatic?

The behavior of Storybook in development and production mode is different: styles are applied differently, and development packages may be scrapped in production mode. Chromatic runs the `build-storybook` command during the build process (different from `start-storybook`).

When you test Storybook locally, it's essential to mock the production mode by running: `npx http-server storybook-static -o`

Passing a storybook dev built is possible, but we highly recommend not doing that.
