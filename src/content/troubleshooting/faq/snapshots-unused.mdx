# What happens to my snapshots if I don't use them?

Chromatic will reset the snapshot count monthly, calculated based on the day you've signed up. For instance, if you signed up on February 14th, your count will be reset on the 14th of each month. Any remaining snapshots from the previous month will not accumulate.
