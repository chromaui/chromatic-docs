# Why is my build failing with the error message `Build verification timed out`?

As your project grows and you add more components to test, you may hit time-out errors. To resolve this issue, try compressing Storybook using the flag `--zip`. You can learn more about this here: [Run Chromatic on large projects](/docs/github-actions/#run-chromatic-on-large-projects).

Another option is incrementing the building time using environment variables for Storybook and Chromatic: `STORYBOOK_BUILD_TIMEOUT` and `CHROMATIC_TIMEOUT`. You can learn more about these environment variables here: [Environment variables](/docs/cli/#environment-variables).
