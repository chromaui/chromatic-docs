Skipping Chromatic builds on the `main` branch can lead to inaccurate visual comparisons. This is because feature branches fork off from main and rely on the main branch's baseline for comparison.

On the contrary, some users run builds only on the `main` branch after making changes on feature branches. This way the baseline on the `main` branch always compares against the new set of changes merged into it.

When builds are skipped on `main`, each feature branch develops independently, with baselines diverging over time. This leads to more diffs because multiple independent changes accumulate before being reconciled. s
