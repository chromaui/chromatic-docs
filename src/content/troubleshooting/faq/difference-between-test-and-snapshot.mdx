# What is the difference between a 'Test' and a 'Snapshot'??

A test is the expression of a piece of UI in a specific state. Chromatic uses tests to verify [visual appearance](/docs) and [UI functionality](/docs/interactions). By default, Chromatic uses your Storybook stories as tests. If you're integrating [Playwright](/docs/playwright) or [Cypress](/docs/cypress), Chromatic reuses your existing E2E tests for visual verification.

A [snapshot](/docs/snapshots) is an image of a test that is captured by our Capture Cloud infrastructure. A test can have [multiple snapshots](/docs/billing/#snapshots) for dimensions like browsers, themes, and viewports.

## Snapshots vs TurboSnaps

[TurboSnaps](/docs/turbosnap/#pricing) are snapshots we've copied over from existing baselines that have no code changes. Since TurboSnaps require fewer resouces, we bill them at 1/5th of the cost of a regular snapshot.

If you've enabled TurboSnap, each build will show a count of snapshots and TurboSnaps used.

The scenario below shows how billable snapshots are calculated when your tests run across multiple browsers and include TurboSnaps and regular snapshots.

| Test count | Browsers   | Viewports  | TurboSnaps    | Snapshots    | Billable Snapshots    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 10 tests   | 2 browsers | 1 viewport | 10 TurboSnaps | 20 snapshots | 22 billable snapshots |
