# What is the difference between a 'Test' and a 'Snapshot'??

A test is when you compare a snapshot with an older snapshot (from the ancestor build) to find the comparison. We detect the changes on your tests for each build.

A snapshot is a picture we take of the component. We compare snapshots from one build to its ancestor. In some cases, a build inherits the snapshot from an ancestor build. Learn more about ancestor builds here.

There's a difference between TurboSnaps and snapshots. Let's review the following example:

![](.././../../images/diff-between-test-and-snapshot.png)

This project has 2897 tests. 11396 were TurboSnaps, and 192 were snapshots. TurboSnaps and snapshots are billed differently. The billing for this build would be:

192 regular snapshots

11396 TurboSnaps (calculated as 0.2 x 11396 = 2279.2 regular snapshots)
