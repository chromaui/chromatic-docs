# What happens when I run out of snapshots on the free plan?

Free plans come with 5000 snapshots per month. Once free snapshots are exhausted, testing & review will become paused until the next month at which time Chromatic will again begin taking snapshots and functionality will automatically resume. Upgrading to a paid plan will immediately resume testing & review.
