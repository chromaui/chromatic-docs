# Why is my build failing with component errors?

When a test fails to render, the associated build will be badged with a "Component error" label. This means that Chromatic cannot render one or more components, which will prevent you from accepting the changes and passing the build. We recommend fixing the associated errors and re-running the build to ensure your tests pass. If you need guidance on fixing the errors, please refer to our [troubleshooting snapshots guide](/docs/troubleshooting-snapshots).

If you're still having trouble, contact us via our in-app chat or email us at support@chromatic.com.
