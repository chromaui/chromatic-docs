# Why can't I see any of my projects?

To locate your Chromatic project, you should start at the account level where all your projects are listed.

You can click the hamburger menu in the upper-left corner to expand your accounts and find the project under `Shared with you`.

If the project wasn't deleted but you don't see it in the Projects menu, it could be because it has been shared with you and is under a different account. It's important to keep in mind that restoring the data is impossible if a project is deleted, even unintentionally.

If the project is linked to a git repository, check to ensure your repository permissions haven't changed. Since Chromatic mirrors access for linked projects based on repository permissions, any change to your repository access could impact your ability to access your project within Chromatic.

If the project isn't listed and you're still unable to find your projects, please contact us via our **in-app chat** or email us at **support@chromatic.com**.
