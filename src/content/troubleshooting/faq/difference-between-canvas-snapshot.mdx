# What is the difference between 'Snapshot' and 'Canvas'?

**Canvas** is an interactive environment that renders your test code live in the browser. With Storybook, it displays the story, and with Playwright or Cypress, it shows the archive of your E2E test. It visualizes the *final state* of the test UI.

A **Snapshot** is the image captured by Chromatic's cloud browser, showing what the browser *saw* when it rendered the test. This could be the component's *initial* or *intermediate* state, and it might differ from the `Canvas` due to various reasons, such as JavaScript execution being blocked during capture, which can prevent certain elements from being captured, or the use of the `isChromatic()` function to alter rendering on Chromatic.
