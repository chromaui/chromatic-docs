# Is VPN supported?

Using a VPN is supported. If your organization has **IP** restrictions enabled, you'll need to add our IPs to your allowed list and ensure your firewall or proxy allows HTTPS traffic to `*.chromatic.com`.
Note that for Chromatic to function properly, **port 443** must be enabled.

If you encounter any issues while using a VPN, please reach out to our support team for assistance.
