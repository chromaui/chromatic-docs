# Do you support mobile testing?

Chromatic doesn't currently support mobile testing, but you can test your UI at smaller viewport sizes using:
* [Modes](/docs/viewports/) to control viewport sizing for stories
* Configuring viewports within [Playwright](/docs/playwright/configure/#viewports) and [Cypress](/docs/cypress/configure/#viewports) tests
