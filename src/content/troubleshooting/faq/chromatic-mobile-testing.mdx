# Do you support mobile testing?

Chromatic doesn't currently support mobile testing, but you can test your UI at smaller viewport sizes using:

- [Modes](/docs/storybook/viewports/) to control viewport sizing for stories
- Configuring viewports within [Playwright](/docs/viewports#playwright) and [Cypress](/docs/viewports#cypress) tests
