# How is this compared to end-to-end testing tools like Playwright and Cypress?

Chromatic complements your existing end-to-end tests in Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium.

End-to-end tests verify user flows like “buy now” or “sign up”. They drive the browser to different pages of a running app and assert functionality. Teams use them in moderation to test the most critical user flows because they can be time-consuming to run.

Visual tests with Chromatic run alongside E2E tests to ensure flows look correct. Chromatic offers time-saving integrations for [Playwright](https://www.chromatic.com/playwright) and [Cypress](https://www.chromatic.com/cypress).

#### Using Storybook?

With Storybook, you already write stories as a natural part of UI development. Chromatic transforms these stories into visual tests. That gives you expansive UI coverage without having to write tests.
