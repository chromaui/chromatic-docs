# What is the difference between the **accepted** and **inherited** baseline?

The **accepted** baseline is the test when a new baseline was accepted.

Since then, every time Chromatic tests the story, it has looked “the same” and passed visual review.

The **inherited** baseline is the most recent passed test for the story.

The accepted baseline is from an older build and the inherited baseline is from a very recent build.
Usually both snapshot images look the same.
