# Onboarding Guide - Advanced Testing Techniques

## Story Modes and Viewports

### Story Modes

Story Modes allow you to test your components in different states and variants, making your testing more comprehensive:

- [Story Modes](/docs/modes/) - Configure different states and variants for your stories. This powerful feature lets you test components in various contexts like dark mode, RTL, or different viewports.
- [Video Walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/f37e471a3e364c94a20a29df5772808c?sid=80540d7b-9222-4027-833c-2d20104593f4) - Watch a detailed demonstration of how to set up and use Story Modes effectively.

### Cross-Browser Testing

Ensure your components work consistently across different browsers:

- [Cross-Browser Testing Guide](https://www.chromatic.com/blog/cross-browser-testing/) - Learn how to test your components across multiple browsers and platforms, and when it makes sense.

## Interactive Testing Demo

### Interaction Tests

Interactive testing allows you to verify that your components behave correctly when users interact with them.
These are your functional tests, and are a great compliment to your visual tests.
Here's how to get started:

- Learn about [Storybook Interactions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/interactions) - Understand how to write and run interaction tests for your components.
- Explore the [Example App](https://main--5f84c5baa35bdd0022a7684f.chromatic.com/?path=/story/userflows-app--to-checkout-page&globals=viewport:responsive) - See a real-world example of interaction testing in action.
- Review the [Code Implementation](https://github.com/yannbf/mealdrop/blob/main/src/pages/UserFlows.stories.tsx) - Study the code patterns used in a production application.

### Visual Test Addon (VTA)

Visual testing is a powerful way to catch UI regressions:

- [VTA](/docs/visual-tests-addon/) - This Storybook addon is an integral part of greatly reducing the
  feedback loop for engineers when making UI changes, and allows you to run Chromatic inside of Storybook.
  The typical workflow is:
  - Engineer makes UI changes
  - Reviews the changes in Storybook
  - Potentially makes additional changes based on a manual review of the story
  - Run the VTA and get feedback quickly on potential visual changes or regressions
  - The VTA saves on time, CI build minutes, and context switching.
  - Requires Storybook 8.0 or higher for the best experience.

### Accessibility and Coverage

Ensure your components are accessible and well-tested:

- Be ready for The European Accessibility Act (EEA)
- [Experimental Addon Test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/experimental-addon-test) - A powerful tool for testing component behavior and accessibility within Storybook.
- Review the [Code Implementation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/core/src/test) - See how to implement comprehensive testing in your project.
- [Accessibility Testing](https://www.chromatic.com/features/accessibility-test) - Learn how to test your components for accessibility in an automated fashion with Chromatic.

## Data Mocking and Consistency

### Mock Service Worker (MSW)

MSW helps you create reliable tests by controlling network requests and module behavior.
Storybook is designed to build your components in isolation, for rapid iteration and consistent tests in Chromatic.

- [Network Requests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/mocking-data-and-modules/mocking-network-requests) - Learn how to mock API calls and network requests for consistent testing.
- [Module Mocking](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/mocking-data-and-modules/mocking-modules) - Understand how to mock external dependencies and modules.
- [Storybook RSC Example](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook-rsc-demo/blob/main/package.json) - See how to implement mocking in a React Server Components environment.
  - [Straightforward Session Mock](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook-rsc-demo/blob/main/lib/session.mock.ts)
  - [More Complex DB Mock](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook-rsc-demo/blob/main/lib/db.mock.ts)

### Test Coverage

Comprehensive test coverage ensures your components are well-tested:

- [Test Coverage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/test-coverage) - Understand how to measure and improve your test coverage.
