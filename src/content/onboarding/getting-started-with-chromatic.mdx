# Onboarding Guide - Getting Started

We've worked with many teams to help them get started with Chromatic. This guide is designed to help you onboard your team and get the most out of Chromatic.
We recommend you follow this guide in order, but feel free to skip around if you already have some of these steps completed.

## 1. Create a Chromatic Account

- [Sign up for Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/signup) using your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab account.
- If you don't have the ability to use a git account, you can sign up for Chromatic using an email address and password.
  - Read more about unlinked accounts [here](/docs/access/#unlinked-projects) and how to setup an unlinked account [here](/docs/faq/chromatic-sso-on-premises-other-git/)
- If you are using SSO configured via your enterprise plan, you will visit your dedicated subdomain instead.
  - Reach out to your Chromatic CSM, Account Executive, or Solutions Engineer if you are unsure of your subdomain.

## 2. Create a Project within Chromatic

- Create your first project.
  - You can either create a Storybook, Playwright, or Cypress project.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to set up your project.
  - Chromatic will guide you through the process of setting up your project and installing the Chromatic CLI.
  - You can also set up Chromatic as a GitHub Action.
  - If you are using a monorepo, you can set up Chromatic to work with your [Monorepo](/docs/github-actions#run-chromatic-on-monorepos).

## 3. Install the Chromatic CLI and Run a Build

- Confirm that you have run your First Build.
  - You can do this by following the on screen prompt and then running the build locally via `npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-token>`.

## 4. Confirm that Chromatic is integrated with a git provider

- [Linked Projects](/docs/access/#linked-projects)
- [On-prem GitHub or GitLab](/docs/access/#how-do-i-link-my-project-to-github-enterprise-server-or-gitlab-self-managed)
- Confirm that [Mandatory Status Checks](/docs/mandatory-pr-checks/#github) are configured

## 5. Upgrade your Storybook

Storybook is constantly improving, and so is Chromatic. We recommend you keep your Storybook version up to date to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.
This also ensures stability and reliability for snapshots within Chromatic.
We have a [guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/migration-guide/index) to help you upgrade your Storybook version to version 8.

If you are using Storybook 8 or later, it's much more straightforward to upgrade.

- You can run `npx storybook@latest upgrade` and the CLI and automigrations will handle the rest.

## 6. Go over Setup and Flags for CI

There are many options to configure your CI to work optimally with your project.
Here are some resources to help you get started:

    - [Configuration Options](/docs/configure/#options)
    - [Chromatic on Monorepos](/docs/custom-ci-provider/#run-chromatic-on-monorepos)
    - [Chromatic on GitHub Actions](/docs/github-actions)

If you use a different CI provider, we have many others listed in the CI section.

## 7. Introduction to TurboSnap

TurboSnap is a feature of Chromatic that allows you to snapshot your components in a more efficient way.
TurboSnap is available for Storybook-based projects and uses a dependency graph to only snapshot the components that have changed.
