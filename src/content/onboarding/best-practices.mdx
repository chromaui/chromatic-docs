# Onboarding Guide - Reporting, Customization, and Best Practices

## Chromatic Overview

### Billing and Usage

Understanding your Chromatic usage and managing your billing is crucial for effective project management. Here's what you need to know:

- [Usage Reports](/docs/billing/#usage-reports) - Access usage reports for each billing period on the billing page.
- [Usage Alerts](/docs/billing/#usage-alerts) - Set up notifications for usage thresholds. Get proactive alerts when you're approaching your plan limits.
- [Notifications](/docs/notifications/#notifications) - Configure and manage your notification preferences. Stay informed about build statuses, review requests, and more.

### Handling False Positives

False positives can be frustrating, but Chromatic provides tools to help you manage them effectively:

- [Troubleshoot Snapshots](/docs/troubleshooting-snapshots/) - Learn how to identify and fix common snapshot issues.
- Use the [Trace Viewer](/docs/troubleshooting-snapshots/#debug-snapshots-with-trace-viewer-beta) - Debug snapshot issues with a visual timeline of component rendering.
  - The trace viewer is available within the Chromatic UI when you re-run a build after denying the inconsistent snapshot.
  - NOTE: The trace viewer will not appear for `Component Errors`, `Story Errors`, or `Infrastructure Errors`.

### Asset Loading Best Practices

Proper asset management is crucial for consistent snapshots:

- [Best Practices](https://github.com/yannbf/storybook-image-loading-best-practices) for handling:
  - Videos - Learn how to handle video content without causing flaky tests
  - Images - Optimize image loading for reliable snapshots
  - Fonts - Ensure consistent font rendering across builds
- Reduce inconsistent snapshots through proper asset management - Implement strategies to maintain test stability.

## Storybook Customization and Best Practices
