# Accessibility Testing

Accessibility Regression Testing combines Storybook and axe with Chromatic's regression workflow for a unique approach:

- ðŸ§©Â **Component-first testing** catches issues at their source. Fix one component and solve problems across every page it touches.
- ðŸš¦**Regression detection** is the secret sauce. Instead of drowning in violation reports, Chromatic establishes baselines and flags only what changed in each PR.
- **ðŸ“ˆÂ Real-time reports** that offer a bird's-eye view of accessibility issues across all components, helping you track progress toward WCAG compliance.

We're actively developing this feature. To learn more, read the [full announcement and sign up for our early access program](https://www.chromatic.com/blog/sneak-peek-accessibility-regression-testing/).
