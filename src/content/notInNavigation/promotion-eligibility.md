# Promotion code eligibility

We're thrilled to welcome new customers to Chromatic with a signup credit. Check if you're eligible using the criteria below.

#### Criteria

- You have a promotion code.
- You're a new customer. That means you've signed up within the last 7 days.
- Your account is for an "organization" you belong to with other teammates not your personal account. For example, a GitHub Organization, Bitbucket Group, or GitLab Team.

<div class="aside">

If you have an email/password account, it must be associated with a team that has multiple [collaborators](/docs/collaborators) within it. Promotion codes for email/password accounts will be honored at our discretion.

</div>

#### Not applicable

- Individual user accounts (for example, your personal GitHub account).
- Accounts that already have existing discounts or promotions applied.
- Existing customers that already use Chromatic in other parts of their organization.

#### Expiration date

The promotion code for new customers will expire 1 year after being applied or when the signup credit is exhausted, whichever comes first.
