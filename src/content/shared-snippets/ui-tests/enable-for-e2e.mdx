## Enable

Visual tests are enabled by default for all new projects. If you have an existing project, you can enable visual tests by clicking the "Enable UI Tests" button on the manage page. Here you can also select the browsers you want to test in.

All snapshots are taken in Chrome by default. Select additional browsers to expand test coverage in 1-click.
