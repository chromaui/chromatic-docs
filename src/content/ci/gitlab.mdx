# Automate Chromatic with GitLab Pipelines

Chromatic’s automation can be included as part of your GitLab pipeline workflow with relative ease.

## Setup

To integrate Chromatic with your existing pipeline, you'll need to add the following:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<IntegrationSnippets>
  <Fragment slot="storybook">
    ```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"

<div class="aside">

We recommend saving the project token as a masked environment variable named `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` for security reasons. When the Chromatic CLI is executed, it will read the environment variable automatically without any additional flags. Refer to the official GitLab [environment variables documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html#mask-a-cicd-variable) to learn more about it.

</div>

### Performance optimization

To improve the performance of your pipeline, you can use the [interruptible](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#interruptible) option if a job should be canceled when a newer pipeline starts before the job completes. This is the recommended strategy as the external status checks won't update by default, even if you create a new build for the same branch.

This keyword has no effect if [automatic cancellation of redundant pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#auto-cancel-redundant-pipelines) is disabled. When enabled, a running job with `interruptible: true` is canceled when starting a pipeline for a new change on the same branch.

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
image: node:jod

stages:
  - UI_Tests

cache:
  key: $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG-$CI_PROJECT_DIR
  paths:
    - .npm/

before_script:
  # ⚠️ See your package manager's documentation for the correct command to install dependencies in a CI environment.
  - npm ci

Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  script:
    - npx chromatic

  # The external Chromatic status checks won't be canceled when a newer pipeline starts before the job completes saving you build minutes
  # You may get an increase in the number of builds, but they won't cancel each other.
  interruptible: true
```

### Run Chromatic on specific branches

If you need to customize your workflow to run Chromatic on specific branches, adjust your pipeline like so:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Adds Chromatic as a job
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  script:
    - npx chromatic

  #👇Filters the execution to run only on the main branch.
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
      when: always
```

<div class="aside">

Read the official GitLab [conditional pipeline documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules).

</div>

Now your pipeline will only run Chromatic in the `main` branch.

### Run Chromatic on large projects

Chromatic is prepared to handle large file uploads (with a limit of 5000 files, including stories and assets). If your project exceeds this limit, we recommend adjusting your pipeline and run the `chromatic` command with the `--zip` flag to compress your build before uploading it. For example:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Adds Chromatic as a job
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  # 👇 Runs Chromatic with the flag to compress the build output.
  script:
    - npx chromatic --zip
```

### Run Chromatic on monorepos

Chromatic can be run on monorepos that have multiple subprojects. Each subproject will need it's own project token.

#### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you're in the correct working directory for the subproject.
2. Have `build-storybook` npm script in the subproject's `package.json` file OR explicitly name the script using the `--build-script-name` CLI flag and make sure the script is listed in the subproject's `package.json` file.

If you've already built your Storybook in a separate CI step, you can adjust your workflow to include the `--storybook-build-dir` CLI flag to point to the build output directory.

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# .gitlab-ci.yml

# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Runs Chromatic in parallel for each monorepo subproject.
Chromatic_publish_project_1:
  stage: UI_Tests
  before_script:
    # Other steps
    - cd packages/project_1
  script:
    - npx chromatic
  variables:
    CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN: $CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1

chromatic_publish_project_2:
  stage: UI_Tests
  before_script:
    # Other steps
    - cd packages/project_2
  script:
    - npx chromatic
  variables:
    CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN: $CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
```

<div class="aside">

Additional paralellization can be achieved when configuring your workflow to run Chromatic on multiple subprojects. Read the official GitLab [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_control.html#parallelize-large-jobs).

</div>

### Disable Shallow Cloning

GitLab performs a shallow clone by default, which can lead to required patch builds depending on how frequently you run builds between commits. In order to avoid this, adjust your workflow to include a `GIT_DEPTH` of `0`. This ensures Chromatic can fetch your entire git history, without having to adjust your general `Git strategy` settings within GitLab:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# 👇 Sets the depth to fetch all git history
variables:
  GIT_DEPTH: 0
```

### Enable TurboSnap

TurboSnap is an advanced Chromatic feature implemented to improve the build time for large projects, disabled by default once you add Chromatic to your CI environment. To enable it, you'll need to adjust your existing workflow and run the `chromatic` command with the `--only-changed` flag as follows:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Adds Chromatic as a job
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  # 👇 Enables Chromatic's TurboSnap feature.
  script:
    - npx chromatic --only-changed
```

<div class="aside">

TurboSnap is highly customizable and can be configured to fit your requirements. For more information, read our [documentation](/docs/turbosnap).

</div>

### UI Test and UI Review

[UI Tests](/docs#test-how-uis-look--function) and [UI Review](/docs/review) rely on [branch and baseline](/docs/branching-and-baselines) detection to keep track of [snapshots](/docs/snapshots). We recommend the following configuration.

#### Command exit code for "required" checks

If you are using pull request statuses as required checks before merging, you may not want your pipeline to fail if test snapshots render without errors (but with changes). To achieve this, pass the flag `--exit-zero-on-changes` to the `chromatic` command, and your step will continue in such cases. For example:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Adds Chromatic as a job
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  # 👇 Runs Chromatic with the flag to prevent pipeline failure
  script:
    - npx chromatic --exit-zero-on-changes
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure#options).

</div>

When using `--exit-zero-on-changes` your pipeline execution still stop and fail if your Storybook contains stories that error. If you'd prefer Chromatic _never_ to block your pipeline, you can use `npx chromatic || true`.

#### Re-run failed builds after verifying UI test results

Builds that contain visual changes need to be [verified](/docs/quickstart#4-review-changes). They will fail if you are not using `--exit-zero-on-changes`. Once you accept all the changes, re-run the pipeline and the `Run Chromatic` step will pass.

If you deny any change, you will need to make the necessary code changes to fix the test (and thus start a new build) to get Chromatic to pass again.

#### Maintain a clean "main" branch

A clean `main` branch is a development **best practice** and **highly recommended** for Chromatic. This means testing your `main` branch to ensure builds are passing. It's important to note that baselines will not persist through branching and merging unless you test your `main` branch.

If the builds are a result of direct commits to `main`, you will need to accept changes to keep the main branch clean. If they're merged from `feature-branches`, you will need to make sure those branches are passing _before_ you merge into `main`.

#### GitLab squash/rebase merge and the "main" branch

GitLab's squash/rebase merge functionality creates new commits that have no association to the branch being merged. If you are already using this option, then we will automatically detect this situation and bring baselines over (see [Branching and Baselines](/docs/branching-and-baselines#how-do-baselines-get-preserved-during-squash-and-rebase-merging) for more details).

If you’re using this functionality but notice the incoming changes were not accepted as baselines in Chromatic, then you'll need to adjust the pipeline and include the `--auto-accept-changes` flag. For example:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Checks if the branch is not main and runs Chromatic
Chromatic_Auto_Accept_Changes:
  stage: UI_Tests
  script:
    - npx chromatic --auto-accept-changes
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
      when: always

  # 👇 Checks if the branch is not main and runs Chromatic
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  script:
    - npx chromatic
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
      when: always
      allow_failure: true
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure#options).

</div>

Including the `--auto-accept-changes` flag ensures all incoming changes will be accepted as baselines. Additionally, you'll maintain a clean `main` branch.

If you want to test the changes introduced by the rebased branch, you can adjust your workflow and include a new step with the `ignore-last-build-on-branch` flag. For example:

```yml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Additional pipeline configurations

# Sets the stages for the pipeline
stages:
  - UI_Tests

# 👇 Adds Chromatic as a job
Chromatic:
  stage: UI_Tests
  script:
    # 👇 Option to skip the last build on target branch
    - npx chromatic --ignore-last-build-on-branch=my-branch
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure#options).

</div>

Including the `--ignore-last-build-on-branch` flag ensures the latest build for the specific branch is not used as a baseline.

#### Run Chromatic on external forks of open source projects

You can enable PR checks for external forks by sharing your project token where you configured the Chromatic command (often in `package.json` or in the pipeline step).

Sharing project tokens allows contributors and others to run Chromatic builds on your project, consuming your snapshot quota. They cannot access your account, settings, or accept baselines. This can be an acceptable tradeoff for open source projects that value community contributions.

#### Skipping builds for certain branches

Sometimes you might want to skip running a build for a certain branch, but still have Chromatic mark the latest commit on that branch as "passed". Otherwise pull requests could be blocked due to required checks that remain pending. To avoid this issue, you can run `chromatic` with the `--skip` flag. This flag accepts a branch name or glob pattern.

One use case for this feature is skipping builds for branches created by a bot. For instance, Renovate automatically updates a projects dependencies. Although some dependencies can result in UI changes, you might not find it worthwhile to run Chromatic for every single dependency update. Instead, you could rely on Chromatic running against the `main` or `develop` branch.

To skip builds for `renovate` branches, use the following:

```shell
npx chromatic --skip 'renovate/**'
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure#options).

</div>

To apply this to multiple branches, use an "extended glob". See the [globs guide] for details.

```shell
npx chromatic --skip '@(renovate/**|your-custom-branch/**)'
```
