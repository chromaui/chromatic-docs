# Automate Chromatic with Semaphore

Chromatic's automation can be included as part of your Semaphore workflow with relative ease.

## Setup

To integrate Chromatic with your existing workflow, you'll need to add the following:

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<div class="aside">

We recommend saving the project token as an secret named `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` for security reasons. When the Chromatic CLI is executed, it will read the value automatically without any additional flags. Refer to the official Semaphore [secrets documentation](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/using-semaphore/secrets) to learn more about it.

</div>

### Run Chromatic on specific branches

If you need to customize your workflow to run Chromatic on specific branches, adjust your workflow like so:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

blocks:
  # Other jobs implemented in the workflow

  # üëá Adds Chromatic as a job
  - name: Chromatic
    run:
      when: branch = 'main' # üëà Filters the execution to run only on the main branch
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic
```

<div class="aside">

Read the official Semaphore [conditional job execution documentation](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/using-semaphore/jobs#skip-run).

</div>

Now Chromatic will only run in the `main` branch.

### Run Chromatic on large projects

Chromatic is prepared to handle large file uploads (with a limit of 5000 files, including stories and assets). If your project exceeds this limit, we recommend adjusting your workflow and run the `chromatic` command with the `--zip` flag to compress your build before uploading it. For example:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

blocks:
  # Other jobs

  # üëá Adds Chromatic as a job
  - name: Chromatic
    # Other configuration
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Chromatic
          commands:
            # Other job steps

            # üëá Runs Chromatic with the flag to compress the build output.
            - npx chromatic --zip
```

### Run Chromatic on monorepos

Chromatic can be run on monorepos that have multiple subprojects. Each subproject will need it's own project token stored as an environment variable.

#### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you're in the correct working directory for the subproject.
2. Have `build-storybook` npm script in the subproject's `package.json` file OR explicitly name the script using the `--build-script-name` CLI flag and make sure the script is listed in the subproject's `package.json` file.

If you've already built your Storybook in a separate CI step, you can adjust your workflow to include the [`--storybook-build-dir`](/docs/configure/#options) CLI flag to point to the build output directory.

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

# üëá Adds Chromatic for for each monorepo subproject
blocks:
  - name: Run Chromatic on Project 1
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd apps/frontend
          # Other job steps
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1
      jobs:
        - name: Publish Project 1 to Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1
  - name: Run Chromatic on Project 2
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd packages/ui
            # Other job steps
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
      jobs:
        - name: Publish Project 2 to Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
```

If you want to run Chromatic in parallel for each subproject, you can adjust your workflow as follows:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

blocks:
  # Other jobs

  # üëá Runs Chromatic in parallel for each monorepo subproject
  - name: Run Chromatic on Project 1
    dependencies: []
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd apps/frontend
          # Other job steps
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1
      jobs:
        - name: Publish Project 1 to Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1
  - name: Run Chromatic on Project 2
    dependencies: []
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd packages/ui
          # Other job steps
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
      jobs:
        - name: Publish Project 2 to Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
```

You can also run Chromatic conditionally for each subproject when a specific change is detected. For example:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

blocks:
  # Other jobs

  # üëá Adds Chromatic as a conditional job for each subproject
  - name: Run Chromatic on Project 1
    dependencies: []
    run:
      # üëá Checks for changes in the apps/frontend directory, excluding any MDX files and triggers the worflow execution
      when: 'change_in(''/apps/frontend'', {exclude: ''/apps/frontend/**/*.mdx'', default_branch: ''main''})'
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd apps/frontend
          # Other job steps
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1
      jobs:
        - name: Publish Project 1 to Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_1
  - name: Run Chromatic on Project 2
    dependencies: []
    run:
     # üëá Checks for changes in the packages/ui directory, excluding any MDX files and triggers the worflow execution
      when: 'change_in(''/packages/ui'', {exclude: ''/packages/ui/**/*.mdx'', default_branch: ''main''})'
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd packages/ui
          # Other job steps
      secrets:
        - name: CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
      jobs:
        - name: Publish Project 2 to Chromatic
          commands:
            - npx chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN_2
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Enable TurboSnap

TurboSnap is an advanced Chromatic feature implemented to improve the build time for large projects, disabled by default once you add Chromatic to your CI environment. To enable it, you'll need to adjust your existing workflow and run the `chromatic` command with the `--only-changed` flag as follows:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

blocks:
  # Other jobs

  # üëá Adds Chromatic as a job
  - name: Chromatic
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Chromatic
          commands:
            # Other job steps

            # üëá Enables Chromatic's TurboSnap feature.
            - npx chromatic --only-changed
```

<div class="aside">

TurboSnap is highly customizable and can be configured to fit your requirements. For more information, read our [documentation](/docs/turbosnap).

</div>

### External Pull Requests

By default, Semaphore allows external pull requests to run on your workflow. If you want to restrict this behavior, refer to the official Semaphore [documentation](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/using-semaphore/workflows#pr) to learn more about it.

### UI Test and UI Review

[UI Tests](/docs/test) and [UI Review](/docs/review) rely on [branch and baseline](/docs/branching-and-baselines) detection to keep track of [snapshots](/docs/snapshots). We recommend the following configuration.

#### Command exit code for "required" checks

If you are using pull request statuses as required checks before merging, you may not want your Semaphore job to fail if test snapshots render without errors (but with changes). To achieve this, pass the flag `--exit-zero-on-changes` to the `chromatic` command, and your job will continue in such cases. For example:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

# üëá Adds Chromatic as a job
blocks:
  - name: Chromatic
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Runs Chromatic
          commands:
            # Other job steps

            # üëá Runs Chromatic with the flag to prevent workflow failure
            - npx chromatic --exit-zero-on-changes
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure/#options).

</div>

When using `--exit-zero-on-changes` your build will still stop and fail if your Storybook contains stories that error. If you'd prefer Chromatic _never_ to block the build, you can use `npx chromatic || true`.

#### Re-run failed builds after verifying UI test results

Builds that contain visual changes need to be [verified](/docs/test#verify-ui-changes). They will fail if you are not using `--exit-zero-on-changes`. Once you accept all the changes, re-run the workflow and the `Chromatic` job will pass.

If you deny any change, you will need to make the necessary code changes to fix the test (and thus start a new build) to get Chromatic to pass again.

#### Maintain a clean "main" branch

A clean `main` branch is a development **best practice** and **highly recommended** for Chromatic. This means testing your `main` branch to ensure builds are passing. It's important to note that baselines will not persist through branching and merging unless you test your `main` branch.

If the builds are a result of direct commits to `main`, you will need to accept changes to keep the main branch clean. If they're merged from `feature-branches`, you will need to make sure those branches are passing _before_ you merge into `main`.

#### Squash/rebase merge and the "main" branch

We use GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket APIs respectively to detect squashing and rebasing so your baselines match your expectations no matter your Git workflow (see [Branching and Baselines](/docs/branching-and-baselines#how-do-baselines-get-preserved-during-squash-and-rebase-merging) for more details).

If you‚Äôre using this functionality but notice the incoming changes were not accepted as baselines in Chromatic, then you'll need to adjust the `chromatic` command and include the `--auto-accept-changes` flag. For example:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other configuration here

blocks:
  # üëá Checks if the branch is not main and runs Chromatic
  - name: Chromatic
    run:
      when: branch != 'main'
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Chromatic
          commands:
            # Other job steps

            - npx chromatic

  # üëá Checks if the branch is main and runs Chromatic with the flag to accept all changes
  - name: Runs Chromatic and and auto accept changes
    run:
      when: branch = 'main'
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Chromatic
          commands:
            # Other job steps

            - npx chromatic --auto-accept-changes
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure/#options).

</div>

Including the `--auto-accept-changes` flag ensures all incoming changes will be accepted as baselines. Additionally, you'll maintain a clean `main` branch.

If you want to test the changes introduced by the rebased branch, you can adjust your workflow and include a new step with the `ignore-last-build-on-branch` flag. For example:

```yml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# Other required configuration

blocks:
  # Other jobs

  # üëá Adds Chromatic as a job
  - name: Chromatic
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Chromatic
          commands:
            # Other job steps

            # üëá Option to skip the last build on target branch
            - npx chromatic --ignore-last-build-on-branch=my-branch
```

Including the `--ignore-last-build-on-branch` flag ensures the latest build for the specific branch is not used as a baseline.

#### Run Chromatic on external forks of open source projects

You can enable PR checks for external forks by sharing your project token where you configured the Chromatic command (often in `package.json` or in the pipeline step).

Sharing project tokens allows contributors and others to run Chromatic builds on your project, consuming your snapshot quota. They cannot access your account, settings, or accept baselines. This can be an acceptable tradeoff for open source projects that value community contributions.

#### Skipping builds for certain branches

Sometimes you might want to skip running a build for a certain branch, but still have Chromatic mark the latest commit on that branch as "passed". Otherwise pull requests could be blocked due to required checks that remain pending. To avoid this issue, you can run `chromatic` with the `--skip` flag. This flag accepts a branch name or glob pattern.

One use case for this feature is skipping builds for branches created by a bot. For instance, Dependabot automatically updates a projects dependencies. Although some dependencies can result in UI changes, you might not find it worthwhile to run Chromatic for every single dependency update. Instead, you could rely on Chromatic running against the `main` or `develop` branch.

To skip builds for `dependabot` branches, use the following:

```shell
npx chromatic --skip 'dependabot/**'
```

<div class="aside">

Read our [configuration reference documentation](/docs/configure/#options).

</div>

To apply this to multiple branches, use an "extended glob". See the [globs guide] for details.

```shell
npx chromatic --skip '@(renovate/**|dependabot/**)'
```
