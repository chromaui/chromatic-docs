# Embed stories

Embed stories published to Chromatic in Medium articles, Notion pages, and countless other platforms.

Before we begin, you'll need to figure out which embed format your platform supports: oEmbed or standard `<iframe>`s. From there, paste the URL of a published story in the given format.

## Embed a story with the toolbar

Embed a story with the toolbar by replacing the `<appid>`, `<uploadhash>`, and `<path-to-story>` with the details for your story. You can retrieve this URL by opening your Storybook from a Build or Library screen. Embedding Storybooks by their branch name or commit hash is not supported yet.

```shell
// oEmbed
https://<appid>-<uploadhash>.chromatic.com/?path=<path-to-story>

// iframe embed
<iframe src="https://<appid>-<uploadhash>.chromatic.com/?path=<path-to-story>&full=1&shortcuts=false&singleStory=true" width="800" height="400"></iframe>
```

## Embed a plain story

Embed a plain story without the toolbar by replacing the `<appid>`, `<uploadhash>`, and `<path-to-story>` with the details for your story.

```shell
// oEmbed
https://<appid>-<uploadhash>.chromatic.com/iframe.html?<path-to-story>&viewMode=story

// iframe embed
<iframe src="<appid>-<uploadhash>.chromatic.com/?path=<path-to-story>&viewMode=story&shortcuts=false&singleStory=true" width="800" height="400"></iframe>
```

## Embed a docs page

You can also embed a docs page by replacing the `<appid>`, `<uploadhash>`, and `<path-to-story>` with the details for your story.

```shell
// oEmbed
https://<appid>-<uploadhash>.chromatic.com/iframe.html?<path-to-story>&viewMode=docs

// iframe embed
<iframe src="https://<appid>-<uploadhash>.chromatic.com/?path=<path-to-story>&viewMode=docs&shortcuts=false&singleStory=true" width="800" height="400"></iframe>
```
