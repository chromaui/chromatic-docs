# E2E Visual Tests for Cypress (beta)
Chromatic E2E Visual Tests lets you bring Chromaticâ€™s visual testing toolkit into your existing Cypress workflow. You can use Chromatic to capture snapshots of pages visited during Cypress testsâ€”including DOM, styles, and assetsâ€”and then review and approve them in the Chromatic UI.

## Getting started

### 1. Initialize your Chromatic project

```bash
npx chromatic init --cypress
```

### 2. Add the following to your `cypress/support/index.js` file:

```js
import 'chromatic-cypress/support';
```

### 3. Install our plugin in your `cypress.config.js` file:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");
const { installPlugin } = require('chromatic-cypress');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      installPlugin(on);
    },
  },
});
```

### 4. Prefix your Cypress command with the following, which defines what port Chrome Devtools Protocol should listen to :

Any port is fine, as long as it's not already in use. We recommend using `9222`.

```bash
ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS=--remote-debugging-port=<a-port-number> yarn cypress run
```

### 5. Prepend build scripts with the Cypress-managed downloads folder:

```json
"scripts": {
  "archive-storybook": "CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION=./cypress/downloads archive-storybook",
  "build-archive-storybook": "CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION=./cypress/downloads build-archive-storybook"
}
```

From there, write your Cypress tests as you normally would. Chromatic will automatically take a snapshot of each page visited during your tests, and upload them to the Chromatic cloud for review.

```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    // ðŸ‘‡ navigate to target page
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io');
    // ðŸ‘‡ verify the page title
    cy.title().should('eq', 'Cypress.io: Kitchen Sink')
  })
})
```

## Taking manual snapshots

A snapshot is taken at the end of every test, whether is passes or fails. But you can also programmatically take manual snapshots at specific points in your tests using the `takeSnapshot` function inside your test runs:

```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    // ðŸ‘‡ navigate to target page
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

    // ðŸ“¸ tell Chromatic to take a snapshot of the initial page state
		cy.takeSnapshot()

    // ðŸ‘‡ finish the test by opening the dropdown menu
    cy.get('.dropdown:first-of-type > .dropdown-toggle').click()

    // ðŸ“¸ Chromatic automattically takes a snapshot here, at the end of the test
  })
})
```
