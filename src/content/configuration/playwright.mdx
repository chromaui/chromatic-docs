# E2E Visual Tests for Playwright (beta)
Chromatic E2E Visual Tests let you bring Chromaticâ€™s visual testing toolkit into your existing Playwright workflow. You can use Chromatic to capture snapshots of pages visited during Playwright testsâ€”including DOM, styles, and assetsâ€”and then review and approve them in the Chromatic UI.

## Requirements

- E2E Visual Tests works with end-to-end tests written in [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) v1.12+.

## Getting started

### 1. Initialize your Chromatic project

```bash
npx chromatic init --playwright
```

### 2. Update your Playwright tests with chromatic-playwright imports:
```js
// âž– Remove this line
// import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
// âž• Add this line
import { test, expect } from "chromatic-playwright";

// Then use as normal ðŸ‘‡
test("Homepage", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://mealexpress.com/");

  await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Mealdrop - find your next meal");

  // ...
});
```

### 3. Run Playwright as usual:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn playwright test
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```shell
    npx playwright test
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Then run a Chromatic build through the CLI:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn chromatic --playwright
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```shell
    npm run chromatic --playwright
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This workflow results in tests that allow you to approve changes at a glance inside Chromatic.

## Taking manual snapshots

A snapshot is taken at the end of every test, whether is passes or fails. But you can also programmatically take manual snapshots at specific points in your tests using the `takeSnapshot` function inside your test runs:

```js
import { test, expect, takeSnapshot } from "chromatic-playwright";

// ðŸ‘‡ Add testInfo parameter
test("Can filter product", async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto("/restaurant/dp/B07KMG72");

  await page.locator('.menu__item:first-of-type').click();

  // Call takeSnapshot to take an archive "snapshot"
  // of the page at this point in the test
  // ðŸ‘‡ Pass testInfo to takeSnapshot
  await takeSnapshot(page, testInfo);

  // continue with test
  await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Add to cart" }).click();

  // You can call takeSnapshot multiple times, as necessary
  // To help disambiguate, you can give the snapshot a name,
  // which is passed as the second argument to takeSnapshot
  await takeSnapshot(page, "After adding to cart", testInfo);

  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Cart/);
});
```

Every time this test is run, it produces a published library of snapshots using Chromaticâ€™s cloud. Each snapshot has a unique URL, a fully-inspectable DOM, styling, and assets included:

## Configuration

You can further configure both your Playwright and Chromatic tests with the options described in the following sections.

###  Playwright options

The Chromatic [Playwright Fixture](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) can be configured with `use` like all [Playwright options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options).

Setting options globally can be done in your `playwright.config.js` as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
    import { ChromaticConfig } from "chromatic-playwright";

    export default defineConfig<ChromaticConfig>({
      use: {
        // ...

        // ðŸ‘‡ your option overrides
        disableAutoSnapshot: true,
      },
      // ... your other configuration
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // playwright.config.js

    import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

    export default defineConfig({
      use: {
        // ... 

        // ðŸ‘‡ your global options
        disableAutoSnapshot: true,
      },
      // ... your other configuration
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Options can also be overridden at the test level:

  ```javascript
  // mytest.spec.js

  test.describe("some block", () => {
    // ðŸ‘‡ your option overrides
    test.use({ disableAutoSnapshot: true });

    test("some test", async ({ page }) => {
      // ...
    });
  });
  ```

### E2E options

These options control how the Chromatic archive fixture behaves.

| Option                   | Type      | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disableAutoSnapshot`     | `boolean` | When `true`, will disable the snapshot that happens automatically at the end of a test when using the Chromatic test fixture. |
| `resourceArchiveTimeout` | `number`  | Maximum amount of time that each test will wait for the network to be idle while archiving resources.                        |
| `assetDomains` | `array[string]`  | A list of domains external to the test location that you want Chromatic to also capture assets from, e.g., <code style="display: inline;">['other-domain.com','our-cdn.com']</code>. |

### Chromatic options

These options control how Chromatic behaves concerning the stories of your archives.

| Option                    | Type      | Chromatic Docs                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delay`                   | `number`  | [Delay](/docs/delay/)                                                   |
| `diffIncludeAntiAliasing` | `boolean` | [Threshold for changes](/docs/threshold#anti-aliasing)                  |
| `diffThreshold`           | `number`  | [Threshold for changes](/docs/threshold#setting-the-threshold)          |
| `forcedColors`            | `string`  | [Media Features](/docs/media-features#test-high-contrast-color-schemes) |
| `pauseAnimationAtEnd`     | `boolean` | [Animations](/docs/animations#css-animations)                           |
| `prefersReducedMotion`    | `string`  | [Media Features](/docs/media-features#verify-reduced-motion-animations) |

### Environment variables

Some options can be configured through environment variables.

| Environment variable         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` | If you have configured your project's [`outputDir`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-output-dir) option to be different than the default, you must set the `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` environment variable to the same value. This must be done when starting the Storybook and when building it on CI. This ensures that the Archive Storybook can find the [archives](#what-are-archives) generated by the Test Archiver. |

## Working in Monorepos

Often, when using a monorepo, developers tend to keep their e2e tests in a subdirectory instead of in the root of the project. At the same time, the Storybook and Chromatic configuration details live at the projectâ€™s root. In these cases, you will need to update the `archive-storybook` and `build-archive-storybook` scripts in your `package.json` by setting the [`-c` flag](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/cli-options#build) and `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION` environment variable. For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "archive-storybook": "CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION=path/to/test-results archive-storybook -c path/to/node_modules/@chromaui/archive-storybook/config",
  "build-archive-storybook": "CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_LOCATION=path/to/test-results build-archive-storybook -c path/to/node_modules/@chromaui/archive-storybook/config"
}
```

## Sharded Playwright Runs

When running your Playwright tests over multiple shared CI jobs, youâ€™ll need to wait for all jobs to complete, ensure you save the results in `./test-archives` to be accessible by the next job (for instance using an [artifact in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)), and run Chromatic in a job that depends on all of the shards.

For GitHub actions, that might look like:

```yaml
test:
  name: Run Playwright
  needs: install
  strategy:
    matrix:
      shard: [1, 2]
  steps:
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ strategy.job-total }}

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: playwright-report-${{ matrix.shard }}_${{ strategy.job-total }}
        path: ./test-archives/latest
        retention-days: 30

chromatic:
  name: Run Chromatic
  needs: test
  steps:
    - name: Download all workflow run artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3

    - name: Publish E2E Archives to Chromatic
      uses: chromaui/action@v1
      with:
        projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
        buildScriptName: build-archive-storybook
```

## Frequently asked questions

<details>

<summary>Does this mean we should no longer write stories for our page components?</summary>

No. Our recommendation is still to develop and test your components, including pages, in Storybook. There are benefits to doing so:

- **Coverage**Â â€” Certain states (in-between loading states, unusual API responses) are difficult or impossible to achieve in E2E but simple in Storybook. Itâ€™s much easier to write a story for every possible input of a page.
- **Reproductions**Â â€” If something goes wrong with a snapshot, itâ€™s much easier to pull up the story in Storybook and iterate towards fixing it.
- **[Component Driven Development](https://www.componentdriven.org)**Â â€” Anchoring work and conversations about a UI in a specific state (e.g., settings page for new project) also offers many workflow benefits for development and collaboration.

Unlike Storybook, E2E Visual Testing is well-suited to testing user flows between pages, not just individual page components.

For pages in a legacy project that are otherwise difficult to isolate in Storybook, E2E Visual Tests helps you extend visual test coverage to those pages.

<details>

<summary>What's the difference between E2E Visual Tests and interaction tests?</summary>

Both simulate user behavior, but that's where the similarities end.

E2E Visual Tests are for user flows that go from page-to-page. Chromatic takes snapshots during the Playwright/Cypress test run to detect visual changes in key pages of the user flow. These tests aren't made to express every state of a component because it would be too cumbersome to script and expensive to run.

[Interaction tests](/docs/interactions) simulate user behavior in Storybook stories. When Chromatic runs, it tests those assertions. If the assertion passes, a snapshot is taken and visually tested. If it fails, the test gets badged as "failed". Interaction tests are made to express the states of a component that require user interaction. They do not support user flows that go from page-to-page.
