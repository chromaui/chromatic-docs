# Chromatic Configuration options

These options control how Chromatic behaves. See also [**branching docs**](/docs/branching-and-baselines) and [diagnosing issues](#diagnosing-issues) for when to use some of these flags. Some options are only available as a flag or as an input to the GitHub Action.

Where supported, globs are handled via [picomatch].

### Environment variables

Some options can be configured through environment variables. You will typically only need these when instructed to. Flags take precedence over environment variables. Environment variables are also read from a `.env` file if present.

| Environment variable             | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Diagnosing issues

Getting your Chromatic CI script configured _just right_ can take some trial and error. To help debug issues, you may want to consider using some of the debug flags:

- `--no-interactive`: When running the CLI locally, use this flag to get logs like you would in CI, which are more elaborate than the interactive logs. This is automatically enabled in CI, so adding it to a CI script is useless.
- `--diagnostics-file`: Before terminating the process, this dumps process context information to `chromatic-diagnostics.json`. This is the first place to look if you see things you didn't expect. In a CI system, you'll have to configure this file as a **build artifact** so you can download it. How to do this depends on your CI provider.
- `--dry-run`: Use this if you want to debug the CLI without actually publishing your Storybook or running a Chromatic build. Typically you'd pair this with `--diagnostics-file`.
- `--debug`: This enables verbose logging and `--no-interactive`. Use this if you want to see the nitty-gritty details. Primarily useful if you have issues publishing (uploading) your Storybook to Chromatic.
- `--trace-changed`: Specifically for TurboSnap, you can use this flag to get a printed tree view of the dependencies between changed files (according to Git) and your story files.
- `--only-story-names`: If you have some specific stories which are causing problems, you can use this flag to run a build for just those stories (one or more). If you don't know which stories are available, you can use `--list` to print a list of all stories in your Storybook, though it will require running a Chromatic build.
