# Viewports (legacy Storybook API)

<div class="aside" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">

<p>ðŸš¨&nbsp;&nbsp;The <code>chromatic.viewports</code> feature is now replaced by the new <a href="/docs/modes">Modes API</a>. With Modes, you can test your stories in various viewports and customize global settings. Additionally, you have the flexibility to define specific viewport heights for testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To transition to the new API, please consult the <a href="/docs/modes/viewports#migration-from-viewports-legacy-to-modes">migration guide</a>.</p>
</div>

UI components can respond to device width. Chromatic makes it easy to visual test these cases with the `viewports` parameter. This helps you define one or more viewport sizes to capture. Using viewports requires Storybook 4.0 or later.

## Viewports for a story

To set a viewport, specify one or more screen _widths_ to the `chromatic.viewports` [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters#story-parameters):

```ts title="MyComponent.stories.ts|tsx"
// Adjust this import to match your framework (e.g., nextjs, vue3-vite)
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/your-framework";

import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

const meta = {
  component: MyComponent,
  title: "MyComponent",
} satisfies Meta<typeof MyComponent>;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;

export const StoryName: Story = {
  parameters: {
    //ðŸ‘‡ Defines a list of viewport widths for a single story to be captured in Chromatic.
    chromatic: { viewports: [320, 1200] },
  },
};
```

When Chromatic captures your story, it will create _two_ snapshots on your build, with the browser set at each viewport. These viewports will be treated separately, with independent baselines and distinct approvals.

## Viewports for all stories of a component

Thanks to Storybook's built-in [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters#component-parameters) API, you can also target the viewport at a group of stories or even your entire Storybook. To apply a set of viewports to all components' stories, use:

```ts title="MyComponent.stories.ts|tsx"
// Adjust this import to match your framework (e.g., nextjs, vue3-vite)
import type { Meta } from "@storybook/your-framework";

import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

const meta = {
  component: MyComponent,
  title: "MyComponent",
  parameters: {
    //ðŸ‘‡ Defines a list of viewport widths applied to all stories of a component to be captured in Chromatic.
    // Note only widths are supported, to control width and height, use the modes api
    // https://www.chromatic.com/docs/modes/viewports
    chromatic: { viewports: [320, 1200] },
  },
} satisfies Meta<typeof MyComponent>;
```

### Frequently asked questions

<details><summary>What viewports can I choose?</summary>

A viewport can be any whole number between 200 and 2560 pixels. The maximum number of pixels per snapshot is 25,000,000.

</details>

<details><summary>Can I control the height of the viewport?</summary>

It is not possible to control height with this legacy API. However, you can achieve it using the <a href="/docs/modes/viewports">Modes API</a>.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I assign viewports globally to all components in my Storybook?</summary>

Use modes and set a [project level mode](/docs/modes#stacking-modes).

If youâ€™re still using the legacy API, then assign viewports for the entire Storybook usingÂ [`parameters`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters#global-parameters) in your [`.storybook/preview.js|ts`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure#configure-story-rendering):

```ts title=".storybook/preview.ts"
// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react-vite, vue3-vite)
// if you're using Storybook 9, or with the appropriate renderer otherwise.
import type { Preview } from "@storybook/your-framework";

const preview: Preview = {
  parameters: {
    //ðŸ‘‡ Defines a list of viewport widths applied globally to all stories.
    // Note only widths are supported, to control width and height, use the modes api
    // https://www.chromatic.com/docs/modes/viewports
    chromatic: { viewports: [320, 1200] },
  },
};

export default preview;
```
