# Delay snapshots

Components sometimes trigger custom interactions on render. For example, JavaScript-driven [animations](/docs/animations#javascript-animations) that cannot [otherwise be disabled](/docs/troubleshooting-snapshots) or third-party functionality outside of your control. The `delay` configuration option enables you to define a fixed minimum time to wait before capturing a snapshot, allowing your tests to get into the intended state before Chromatic snapshots it.

## Customizing snapshot delays

Chromatic has a multistage timeout for capturing a snapshot: 15 seconds to render a story and an additional 15 seconds to execute interaction tests, if present. This timing provides a balance for your tests to load resources and be ready for snapshotting. If you need to customize the wait time for Chromatic to capture a snapshot, add the `delay` configuration option to your tests. For example:

Enabling the `delay` configuration in your tests is especially useful when you have an asynchronous action or animations that end after a specific time (e.g., "animate in") to ensure that your component is in the intended state before Chromatic captures a snapshot. However, if you're working with a continuous animation or a third-party element you cannot deactivate, you may need to use an [ignore region](/docs/ignoring-elements) to prevent Chromatic from considering such parts of the UI.

### Use assertions to delay snapshot capture

If you need additional control when Chromatic captures a snapshot, you can adjust your tests to rely on [interaction testing](/docs/interactions) via Storybook's [`play`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function) function, use custom assertions and timeouts with the E2E integration (i.e., [Playwright](/docs/playwright), or [Cypress](/docs/cypress)), verifying that the UI is in the required state before the snapshot is taken. Chromatic waits for the assertions to pass before capturing the snapshot.
