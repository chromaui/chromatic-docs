# Automate Chromatic with BitBucket Pipelines

Chromaticâ€™s automation can be included as part of your BitBucket pipeline workflow with relative ease.

### Setup

To integrate Chromatic with your existing pipeline, you'll need to add the following:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
    # Other steps in the pipeline

      #ðŸ‘‡Adds Chromatic as a step
    - step:
        name: 'Chromatic deployment'
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn install
            #ðŸ‘‡Runs Chromatic
          - yarn chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
```
<div class="aside">
Read the official BitBucket <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/variables-and-secrets/">environment variables documentation</a>.
</div>

For extra security you'll need to configure your own environment variables.

### Run Chromatic on specific branches

If you need to customize your workflow to run Chromatic on specific branches, adjust your pipeline like so:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
  # Other steps in the pipeline

  branches:
    #ðŸ‘‡The example branch will display the message in the console instead of running Chromatic.
    master:
      - step:
         script:
           - yarn chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
```

<div class="aside">
Read the official BitBucket <a href="">conditional pipeline documentation</a>.
</div>

Now your pipeline will run Chromatic in the `main` branch and the example `branch` will show a message.

### UI Test and UI Review

[UI Tests](test) and [UI Review](review) rely on [branch and baseline](branching-and-baselines) detection to keep track of [snapshots](snapshots). We recommend the following configuration.

#### Command exit code for "required" checks

If you are using pull request statuses as required checks before merging, you may not want your pipeline to fail if test snapshots render without errors (but with changes). To achieve this, pass the flag `--exit-zero-on-changes` to the `chromatic` command, and your step will continue in such cases. For example:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
    # Other steps in the pipeline

      #ðŸ‘‡Adds Chromatic as a step in the pipeline
    - step:
        name: 'Chromatic deployment'
        # Other pipeline configuration
        script:
          - yarn install
            #ðŸ‘‡Runs Chromatic with the flag to prevent pipeline failure 
          - yarn chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN --exit-zero-on-changes
```

<div class="aside">
Read our <a href="/docs/cli#chromatic-options"> CLI documentation</a>.
</div>

When using `--exit-zero-on-changes` your pipeline execution still stop and fail if your Storybook contains stories that error. If you'd prefer Chromatic _never_ to block your pipeline, you can use `yarn chromatic || true`.

#### Re-run failed builds after verifying UI test results

Builds that contain visual changes need to be [verified](test#verify-ui-changes). They will fail if you are not using `--exit-zero-on-changes`. Once you accept all the changes, re-run the pipeline and the `Chromatic deployment` step will pass.

If you deny any change, you will need to make the necessary code changes to fix the test (and thus start a new build) to get Chromatic to pass again.

#### Maintain a clean "master" branch

A clean `master` branch is a development **best practice** and **highly recommended** for Chromatic. In practice, this means ensuring that test builds in your `master` branch are passing.

If the builds are a result of direct commits to `master`, you will need to accept changes to keep master clean. If they're merged from `feature-branches`, you will need to make sure those branches are passing _before_ you merge into `master`.


#### BitBucket squash/rebase merge and the "master" branch

BitBucket's squash/rebase merge functionality creates new commits that have no association to the branch being merged. If you are already using this option, then we will automatically detect this situation and bring baselines over (see [Branching and Baselines](branching-and-baselines#squash-and-rebase-merging) for more details).

If youâ€™re using this functionality but notice the incoming changes were not accepted as baselines in Chromatic, then you'll need to adjust the pipeline and include the `--auto-accept-changes` flag. For example:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
      #ðŸ‘‡Checks if the branch is master and runs Chromatic with the flag to accept all changes.
    - step:
        name: 'Deploy to Chromatic and auto accept changes'
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn chromatic --project-token=${CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN} --auto-accept-changes
  pull-requests:
    #ðŸ‘‡Checks if the branch is not master and runs Chromatic
    your-branch:
      - step:
          name: 'Deploy to Chromatic'
          script:
            - yarn chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN

```

<div class="aside">
Read our <a href="/docs/cli#chromatic-options"> CLI documentation</a>.
</div>

Including the `--auto-accept-changes` flag ensures all incoming changes will be accepted as baselines. Additionally you'll maintain a clean `master` branch.

#### Run Chromatic on external forks of open source projects

You can enable PR checks for external forks by sharing your `project-token` where you configured the Chromatic command (often in `package.json` or in the pipeline step).

There are tradeoffs. Sharing `project-token`'s allows _contributors_ and others to run Chromatic. They'll be able to use your snapshots. They will not be able to get access to your account, settings, or accept baselines. This can be an acceptable tradeoff for open source projects who value community contributions.

#### Skipping builds for certain branches

Sometimes you might want to skip running a build for a certain branch, but still have Chromatic mark the latest commit on that branch as "passed". Otherwise pull requests could be blocked due to required checks that remain pending. To avoid this issue, you can run `chromatic` with the `--skip` flag. This flag accepts a branch name or glob pattern.

One use case for this feature is skipping builds for branches created by a bot. For instance, Renovate automatically updates a projects dependencies. Although some dependencies can result in UI changes, you might not find it worthwhile to run Chromatic for every single dependency update. Instead, you could rely on Chromatic running against the `master` or `develop` branch.

To skip builds for `renovate` branches, use the following:

```bash
chromatic --skip 'renovate/**'
```

<div class="aside">

</div>

To apply this to multiple branches, use an "extended glob". See [picomatch] for details.

```bash
chromatic --skip '@(renovate/**|your-custom-branch/**)'
```
