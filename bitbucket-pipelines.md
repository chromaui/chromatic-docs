# Automate Chromatic with BitBucket Pipelines

Chromaticâ€™s automation can be included as part of your BitBucket pipeline workflow with relative ease.

## Initial configuration

Assuming you have a similar configuration in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# pipeline image type
image: node:12.0.0 

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: 'Build and test'
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn install
          - yarn test
```

To integrate Chromatic with your existing pipeline, you'll need to add the following:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# pipeline image type
image: node:12.0.0

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: 'Chromatic deployment'
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn install
          - yarn test
          # Runs Chromatic
          - yarn chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
```

For extra security you'll need to configure your own environment variables.

### Run Chromatic on specific branches

If you need to customize your workflow to run Chromatic on specific branches, adjust your pipeline like so:

```yml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml

# pipeline image type
image: node:12.0.0

# A sample pipeline implementation
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: 'Chromatic Deployment'
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn install
          - yarn test
          - yarn chromatic --project-token=$CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN
  branches:
    example:  # ðŸ‘ˆ  The example branch will display the message in the console as instead of running Chromatic.
      - step:
         script:
           - echo "Skipping Chromatic deployment"
```

Now your pipeline will run Chromatic in the `main` branch and the example `branch` will show a message.
