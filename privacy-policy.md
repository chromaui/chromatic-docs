## 12. Cookies Notice

This Cookies Notice applies when using our Website.

**Cookie Overview and How They are Used on Our Website**

This helps us to provide you with a good, secure, and personalized experience when you browse our Website and allows us to improve our Website over time.

This may include data on website pages visited prior, during and after visiting our Website, clicks or interactions made with the pages on our Website, consents and preferences, time spent on our pages and date/timestamps of visits and interactions, device identifiers such as IP address or operating system type, and browser type.

We also use “third-party” cookies, which are cookies from a website domain other than our Website. These are used for our Website’s analytics, site functionality, security, and marketing efforts by sharing usage and device-related data with relevant third-parties.

We, and third-parties performing services on our behalf, may use cookies for security purposes (for example, in helping prevent fraud), to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using our services.

We may also use cookies to track your responses to our advertisements and we may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites.

**Web Beacon Overview and How They are Used on Our Website**

The pages of our Website contain images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacons") that allow our third-party service providers and us to count page views or to collect other anonymous data. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, usually 1 by 1 pixel in size, but their presence can be easily seen with your browser’s inspection tools. Web beacons are small in order to minimize both their display and their loading time. Our web beacons may collect, gather, monitor or share personal information about our online service visitors for web tracking purposes; they also may be used to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about the usage of our online services.

For tracking purposes, we use web beacons on our Website along with other technical methods. We also employ third-party services (e.g., Twitter) that collect data remotely through the use of web beacons. This service then returns the completely anonymous data to us as site traffic reports.

**Google Analytics**

In addition to the cookies detailed below, we use Google Analytics to better understand your use of our Website and services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Website, what pages are visited, and what other sites may have been used prior to visiting. Google uses the data collected to track and examine website usage, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services, and to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. More information about how Google Analytics collects and processes data can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Website is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). You can also opt-out of and manage your preferences for Google’s use of personalized advertising and related cookies by visiting Google’s [Ad Settings](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2662856?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), and Google Analytics also offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

**Types of Cookies on Our Website**

We use the following types of cookies for the following purposes:

**Strictly Necessary Cookies**: These cookies are essential for you to browse our Website and use its intended functionality, including accessing secure areas of our Website. These cookies cannot be opted-in or out of.

**Performance Cookies**: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Website. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around our Website. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.

**Functional Cookies**: These cookies enable the Websites to provide enhanced functionality. They may be set by us or by third-party service providers whose services we have added to our pages (for example, embedding videos on webpages).

**Marketing Cookies**: These cookies may be set on our Website by our advertising and marketing service providers. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. This recognition is used to serve relevant adverts, links, or other information about our products and services to users visiting other websites after having previously visited our Website or interacted with our products and services. If you consent to these cookies, you may experience targeted advertising.

**Do Not Track and Third-party Tracking Disclosure**

Certain mechanisms may allow you to send web browser signals, known as “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals, indicating your choice to disable tracking on our Website. We do not respond to browser DNT signals at this time. We may not be aware of or be able to respond to every such mechanism.

Third-parties, other than our service providers (such as our Website’s analytics provider), do not have authorization from us to track which website you visited prior to and after visiting our Website. That said, we cannot control third-party tracking; therefore, there may be some third-party tracking that occurs without our knowledge or consent.
