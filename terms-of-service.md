Chroma is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from access by a Non-Chroma Application.

- 4.2. **Integration with Non-Chroma Applications**

  Chroma Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Non-Chroma Applications. To use such features, Customer may be required to obtain access to Non-Chroma Applications from their providers, and may be required to grant Chroma access to Your account(s) on the Non-Chroma Applications.

## 5. Fees Payment and Terms Audit

- 5.1 **Fees and Expenses**

  For purchased Chroma Services and Support, Customer will pay Chroma the fees set forth in the applicable Subscription, Order, Online Order, and/or SOW. Fees for Services may be based on certain metrics, parameters, and/or limitations as set forth in Chroma’s Services descriptions, Subscription Orders, or in specific SOWs, including for example, and without limitation, metrics related to the size of Customer’s computing environment, application count, application size, and the number of developers using Chromatic.

- 5.2 **Payment Terms**

  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in an applicable Subscription Order or SOW, Chroma will charge Customer credit card specified in an applicable order at the interval indicated in Chroma fees and payment policies or invoice Customer as follows:

  - (a) For Services, upon execution of the applicable Subscription Order.
  - (b) For Consulting and Training Services, monthly in arrears as such Services are delivered by Chroma. Customer will pay all invoices issued by Chroma under Subscription Orders and SOWs in full within thirty (30) days of the date of each invoice, without setoff, counterclaim, or deduction of any kind. All late credit card payments or invoiced amounts not paid by Customer when due will accrue interest at the rate of one percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is lower. Chroma may, in its sole discretion and upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Customer, suspend the provision of Services or Support, as applicable, if any invoice is more than thirty (30) days past due. This right of suspension will not limit any other of Chroma’s rights or remedies related to Customer’s failure to pay. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Chroma's measurements of your use of the Chroma Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. Nothing in these Terms obligates Chroma to extend credit to any party. Chroma may change its fees and payment policies for the Chroma Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the Chromatic website (or such other URL Chroma may provide from time to time). Customer acknowledges and agrees that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Chroma may be shared by Chroma with companies who work on Chroma’s behalf, such as accounting firms, payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Chroma and servicing your account.

- 5.3 **Refunds & Cancellation**

  Customer may cancel and receive a full refund of fees paid within the first thirty (30) days of the initial service provisioning date for orders related to Chromatic. Chroma reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to issue any refunds in the form of credit towards future Chroma Services. Any subsequent Chromatic orders associated to a Customer’s user account or previously associated web domains are not eligible for refund. Customer may only request a cancellation or refund via written notice to Chroma. In the event of cancellation, Customer is responsible for all fees incurred.

- 5.4 **Taxes**

  All fees and expenses charged by Chroma under this Agreement are exclusive of any taxes, duties, or similar charges imposed by any government, and Customer agrees to pay for any and all federal, state, or local sales, use, excise, privilege, or other taxes, duties or assessments, however designated or levied, relating to this Agreement, exclusive of taxes based on Chroma’s net income. If Customer is required to pay any withholding tax, charge, or levy in respect of any payments due to Chroma hereunder, Customer agrees to gross up payments actually made to Chroma such that Chroma receives sums due hereunder in full and free of any deduction for any such withholding tax, charge, or levy.

- 5.5 **Audit**

  During the term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter (the "Audit Period"), Customer agrees to keep and maintain complete and accurate records sufficient to verify Customer’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, payment of applicable Support fees ("Records"). Such Records must include, at a minimum, information regarding Customer’s computing environment and systems on which Support fees are based, including, for example, and without limitation, information relating to Customer’s installation and usage of Chromatic on Customer’s systems. During the Audit Period, Chroma (or its authorized representative) will have the right, upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Customer, to have an independent third-party (subject to Customer’s approval not to be unreasonably withheld) perform an inspection and audit of the Records. Audits will be performed during Customer’s normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s normal business operations. If an Audit reveals that Customer has underpaid Chroma for Support, Customer shall promptly pay such underpaid amounts. Chroma will bear the costs of the Audit provided, however, that if the Audit reveals underpayment by Customer by more than five percent (5%), Customer will reimburse Chroma for the cost of the Audit.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to those of the Receiving Party’s employees and contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information, provided that the Receiving Party takes reasonable measures to ensure that such employees and contractors are bound by non-use and non-disclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. Each party shall be liable for all violations of this Section 7 by its employees and contractors.

- 7.2 **Exclusions**

  The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section 7 will not apply to information of the Disclosing Party that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:

  - (i) Was in the possession of the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure without any restrictions as to confidentiality of such information.

  - (ii) Was generally available to the public at the time of disclosure or became generally available to the public after disclosure through no breach of this Agreement or other wrongful act by the Receiving Party.
  - (iii) was rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure.
  - (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required to comply with binding orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it provided that, to the extent legally permitted, the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential Information as is required by the governmental entity, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information disclosed.

- 7.3 **Return and Destruction**

  Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy the Confidential Information, including all copies thereof (certifying the fact of such destruction to the Disclosing Party), with the exception that the Receiving Party (a) may retain an archival copy of the Confidential Information and (b) is not required to destroy or alter computer based backup files generated in the normal course of its business. Any Confidential Information contained in such archival copies or backup files shall, however, remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Section 7.

- 7.4 **Equitable Relief**

  The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach of the obligations of this Section 7 may cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm for which an adequate remedy at law may not be available and that, therefore, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to all other remedies available at law.

- 12.9 **No Waiver**

  The failure of a party to enforce any provision or exercise any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such provision or right and shall not preclude such party from enforcing such provision or exercising such right at any later time.
