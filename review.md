# UI Review


UI Tests protect you from accidental regressions. But, before you ship, you‚Äôll want to invite developers, designers, and PMs to review the UI, discuss changes, and get the final sign off.

UI Review creates a changeset of the exact visual changes introduced on a new branch. You assign reviewers who can comment and request tweaks on changes that aren‚Äôt quite right. Think of it like a code review, but for your UI.

</div>

## Enable

Enable UI Review for your project on the Manage screen.

![Enable UI Review](img/uireview-for-docs.png)

Once enabled, visit the Reviews tab in the web app sidebar. There you‚Äôll be prompted to install the GitHub app or webhooks for GitLab/Bitbucket.

<div class="aside">
<p><b>Note:</b> You must <a href="ci">set up CI</a> so that Chromatic is able to run builds for each commit on the PR branch.</p>
</div>

## Understanding the Review

Once a Review has been created‚Äîeither manually or through CI‚Äînavigate to the Reviews tab and select the appropriate Review. You will then land on the Activity tab, which shows a timeline of [builds](setup#view-published-storybook), active discussions, and Review status. This showcases what needs to be done in the Review process.

![Activity tab](img/prscreen-activity.png)

### Invite teammates

Invite other developers, designers, PMs, and stakeholders to help review changes. This closes the feedback loop between disciplines and helps you find the answer to ‚Äúdoes this look right?‚Äù

If you [linked your project](access#linked-projects) to GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, your project permissions are synced so collaborators can sign in to review immediately. If your [project is unlinked](access#unlinked-projects), use the project invite code to add collaborators.

#### Assign reviewers

Use the Assign Reviewers link on the Review‚Äôs Activity screen to choose reviewers from the project‚Äôs collaborators. Reviewers will be emailed a link to the Review screen to begin their review.

![assign reviewers by picking from your list of collaborators](img/assign-reviewers.png)

#### Pull requests from forks

Chromatic supports UI Test and UI Review across forks, but there's some caveats. First, it only works with [CI integration](ci#configure-ci) configured to also build PR branches from forks. Secondly, you must expose your project token so that forks can use it. The easiest way to do that is to simply include it in in your `package.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "chromatic": "chromatic --project-token <CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

If you use a CI provider other than GitHub, you can still use an environment variable. Just make sure your CI is configured to also build forked branches. The project token does not grant access to the project (it can only retrieve a strict set of insensitive data), but it does allow running new builds which count against your snapshot quota.

## Review the changes

The Review screen includes a Changeset tab showing a side-by-side view of all visual changes introduced on your head branch. It compares the UI on the head branch to the base branch. You‚Äôll see each change‚Äôs component story before and after the head branch changes are applied to your base branch.

![Changeset tab](img/prscreen-changes.png)

<div class="aside"><b>Tip:</b> To hint at what UI changed, toggle the highlighted diff (in neon green) on and off.</div>

#### Discussions

Reviewers can request updates to the implementation via the comment box beneath each change. Discussions are threaded and attached to the specific story represented by the change.

![Changeset Comments](img/ui-changes-comments.png)

## UI checklist

At the bottom of the Review screen‚Äôs [activity tab](review#find-your-pull-request) is a list of tasks that must be completed before UI is ready to be signed off on. If changes are found, the Review will enter the **üü°&nbsp;Pending** state. When changes are approved and checklist items are complete, the Review will be **üü¢&nbsp;Passed**. Here‚Äôs how to resolve these tasks:

1. Changeset must be approved &rarr; Assign reviewers or approve yourself.
2. Outstanding discussions must be resolved &rarr; Click 'Resolve' on discussions.
3. All assigned reviewers must approve &rarr; Click 'Approve' in the Review screen tab bar.

<div class="aside">
<p><b>Note:</b> Step #3 is not required if you would like to close the Review.
</p>
</div>

![UI Checklist](img/prscreen-ui-checklist.png)

## PR check for "UI Review"

You'll get a 'UI Review' status check for each PR that shows the state of the UI Checklist. Require the check in [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#post-the-build-status-to-a-commit), or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge-856691474.html) to ensure that impactful changes are considered by the team before merging.

# Manual UI Review

Since UI Review is such a core Chromatic feature&mdash;allowing all stakeholders to review and discuss UI changes&mdash;we want everyone to benefit from it. So even if you haven‚Äôt connected your project to a git provider or set up CI, you can still use UI Review.

## Enable UI Review

Before creating a Review, ensure that you‚Äôve enabled UI Review for your project on the Manage screen.

![Enable UI Review](img/uireview-for-docs.png)

## Create a Review

![Create Review](img/create-review.png)
Within your project, navigate to the Reviews page from the sidebar. There you‚Äôll see a ‚ÄúCreate review‚Äù button. Clicking that button will navigate you to a new page where you can create the specific Review you want.

![Create review branches](img/create-review-branches.png)

If you‚Äôre familiar with creating pull or merge requests with git, this process will be very familiar:

- Select the base branch, which is the branch that‚Äôs used as the source of truth for comparison. Typically this will be your main branch.
- Select the head branch, which is the branch that has changes that you want to compare with the source of truth. This is most likely a feature or bug fix branch you‚Äôve recently completed work on.
- Enter a title for the Review.
- Click the ‚ÄúCompare branches‚Äù button to generate your new Review

Your Review is now ready for you and your team to discuss. Follow along from to the [Understanding the Review](review#understanding-the-review) section on for more information on how to benefit the most from UI Review.

<details>
<summary>Glossary</summary>

- <b>Base branch:</b> the branch you want to use as a baseline for the comparison
- <b>Head branch:</b> the branch with the new changes that need to be compared against the base branch

</details>

## PR check for "UI Review"
Manually created Reviews will not create a ‚ÄúUI Review‚Äù status check in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. To create a status check in your Git provider for manually created Reviews, you can use a [custom webhook](integrations#custom-webhooks).

## Closing a Review

While Reviews generated through CI will be closed automatically once the PR branch is merged, Manual UI Reviews are required to be manually closed. So, once a Review is complete, it can be closed by clicking the ‚ÄòClose review‚Äô menu item in the ‚ÄòReview now‚Äô button tooltip. Your review will then be displayed in the list of ‚ÄòClosed‚Äô Reviews on the Reviews page.

![Close Review](img/close-review.png)

<div class="aside">
<p><b>Be aware:</b> closing a Review <b>does not</b> merge the branches in git.</p>
</div>

### Notes:

- In order to create a Review, you will need to have at least two git branches with a build on each.
- If you are trying to review the changes completed in a pull (merge) request, you will want to match the head and base branches of the Review with the respective branches of the pull (merge) request.
- You can only have one open Review at a time with the same branch combination. For example, if your head branch is `new-changes` and your base branch is `main`, you cannot open another Review with `new-changes` as the head branch and `main` as the base branch.
- You can manually create a review for a linked project as well. This feature is available to all projects.

### Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary>When should I ask for UI Review?</summary>

You can initiate a UI Review at any time. However, we recommend doing it later in the development cycle, once baselines have been approved and UI Tests are green. Learn more about [UI review](review).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I disable UI Review if I'd prefer not to use it?</summary>

Yes. Go to the manage page for your project where you can disable UI Review. Chromatic will no longer add status checks to your PRs for UI Review once it is disabled.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What commits does Chromatic use to calculate the UI changeset?</summary>

Similar to [GitHub code review](https://github.com/features/code-review/), Chromatic compares between the latest commit on the PR branch and the 'merge base' commit, that is the commit that is the shared ancestor between the PR branch and the branch it was created from. It is important that Chromatic has run a build on both commits outlined above. If you've recently enabled CI and have existing PRs that you would like to review, ensure Chromatic has run in CI for both branches of that PR.

The process might look something like:

1. Create a new PR to `main` adding Chromatic to CI
1. Merge that PR when everything works well.
1. Update your existing feature PR(s) w/ the latest from `main` (either merge or rebase from main).
