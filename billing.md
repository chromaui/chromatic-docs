# How does Chromatic handles billing and invoices?

When you sign up to a paid plan you're required to include a valid credit card number and a valid email for invoicing. At the end of the month Chromatic will place a charge associated to the subscribed plan.

The values associated to your invoice are account wide and not project wide. As a policy Chromatic will not bill its customers per projects hosted in the platform.

With each charge is an detailed invoice with the amount owed and snapshot usage for the current month. 

## Overages

Depending on the size or number of projects associated to your subscription it's likely that you might run into a situation where you exceed the allotted number of snapshots for your plan. If you need additional snapshots, contact us through our <a class=".intercom-concierge-bot"><b>in-app chat</b></a> or [email](mailto:support@chromatic.com) for an additional follow up. 

These bonus snapshots will only be applied to the current month. The following month the snapshot amount will revert back to the default.

If you find yourself going over the snapshot number associated to your subscribed plan, we recommend updating to a custom plan tailored to your needs. Contact us through our <a class=".intercom-concierge-bot"><b>in-app chat</b></a> or <a href="mailto:support@chromatic.com?Subject=Custom%20plan">email</a>
for more information.

## Refund policy

If you're already a customer, contact us through our <a class=".intercom-concierge-bot"><b>in-app chat</b></a> or [email](mailto:support@chromatic.com) and ask for a refund for the current month usage.

If you're a new customer willing to try Chromatic's paid plans at no-risk, we include a 30 day refund policy. 

#### Multiple refunds

Chromatic will not perform multiple refunds specific to one account. Subsequent refunds will be turned into account credits which can be applied to future invoices.
