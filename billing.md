# How does Chromatic handles billing and invoices?

When you sign up to a paid plan you're required to include a valid credit card number and email for invoices. At the end of the month Chromatic will place a charge associated to the subscribed plan.

Alongside to the charge is an detailed invoice with the amount owed and snapshot usage for the current month. 


## Overages

If you're a customer on a paid subscription plan, contact us through our <a class=".intercom-concierge-bot"><b>in-app chat</b></a> or [email](mailto:support@chromatic.com) for additional follow up.
