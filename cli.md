# Chromatic CLI

The [Chromatic CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromatic) builds and publishes your Storybook. Run `chromatic` in your project directory.

  <source src="img/chromatic-cli-optimized.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<div class="aside">This package was previously named <code>storybook-chromatic</code>. See <a href="#migrating-to-the-new-cli-package">migrating to the new package</a> for details.</div>

## Quick Start

```shell
npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-token>
```

If you customized the way your Storybook runs, you may need to pass additional options.
After the first run, the CLI will automatically ask you to add a script to your `package.json`.

### Installing

Optionally, you can install `chromatic` as a dependency, while using the same script above.

```shell
npm install -D chromatic
```

If you don't install `chromatic` as a dependency, `npx` will download and run the latest version automatically. This has pros and cons:

- üëç You'll never be out of date, you'll use the latest version every time, never have to worry about upgrading Chromatic.
- üëç You won't need to install the package during local development if you're only running it in continuous integration.
- üëé It will be slower to run because the package has to be downloaded first.

## Configuration

### Required options

| CLI flag                  |                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--project-token <token>` | The unique code for your project. Alias: `-t` |

Get your project token from the Chromatic website during onboarding or on your project's Manage page.
This option can also be configured by setting the `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` environment variable.
Environment variables are also read from a `.env` file, if present.

<div class="aside">
Note: <code>--project-token</code> was previously known as <code>--app-code</code>. If you encounter an error referring to this, you should upgrade to the latest version of the Chromatic CLI. See <a href="#migrating-to-the-new-cli-package">migrating to the new package</a>.
</div>

### Storybook options

`chromatic` is zero-config if you have a `build-storybook` script in your `package.json`. Otherwise you might to specify one of these.

| CLI flag                          |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--build-script-name <name>`      | The npm script that builds your Storybook we should take snapshots against. Use this if your Storybook build script is named differently. Defaults to `build-storybook`. Alias: `-b` |
| `--output-dir <dirname>`          | Relative path to target directory for building your Storybook, in case you want to preserve it. Otherwise a temporary directory is used if possible. Alias: `-o`                     |
| `--storybook-build-dir <dirname>` | If you have already built your Storybook, provide the path to the static build directory. Alias: `-d`                                                                                |

<div class="aside">
A placeholder in <code>&lt;angled brackets&gt;</code> denotes a required value, while <code>[square brackets]</code> denote an optional value. An optional flag value is interpreted as <code>true</code> when no value is provided.
</div>

### Chromatic options

These options control how Chromatic behaves with regards to your stories and what to do with them. These might be needed in certain branching situations. See more in the [**branching docs**](branching-and-baselines).

| CLI flag                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `--only-story-names <storypath>`          | Only run a single story or a subset of stories by their name(s). Use the `title` from the story file's default export as the story path, followed by the desired story names. For example, if selecting all stories from a single story file with a `title` of `Example/Button`, this would be `Example/Button/*`. Globs are supported via [picomatch]. This flag can be specified multiple times. |
| `--patch-build <headbranch...basebranch>` | Create a patch build to fix a missing PR comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `--skip [branch]`                         | Skip Chromatic tests, but mark the commit as passing. Avoids blocking PRs due to required merge checks. Only for `[branch]`, if specified.

This flag can be specified multiple times. Requires --only-changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--zip`                                   | Publish your Storybook to Chromatic as a single zip file instead of individual content files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Usage in a GitHub Action

There are examples here: https://github.com/chromaui/chromatic-cli

Do not run this based on a GitHub `pull_request` event. If you do, the commit and branch will get reported wrong, use [our GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-to-chromatic) instead.

## Diagnosing issues

Getting your Chromatic CI script configured _just right_ can take some trial and error. To help debug issues, you may want to consider using some of the debug flags:

- `--no-interactive`: When running the CLI locally, use this flag so you'll get logs like you would in CI, which are more elaborate than the interactive logs. This is automatically enabled in CI, so it's useless to add it in a CI script.
- `--diagnostics`: Before terminating the process, this dumps process context information to `chromatic-diagnostics.json`. This is the first place to look if you're seeing things you didn't expect. In a CI system, you'll have to configure this file as a **build artifact** so you can download it. How to do this depends on your CI provider.
- `--dry-run`: Use this if you just want to debug the CLI without actually publishing your Storybook or running a Chromatic build. Typically you'd pair this with `--diagnostics`.
- `--debug`: This enables verbose logging and `--no-interactive`. Use this if you want to see the nitty gritty details. Mostly useful if you have issues with publishing (uploading) your Storybook to Chromatic.
- `--trace-changed`: Specifically for TurboSnap, you can use this flag to get a printed tree view of the dependencies between changed files (according to Git) and your story files.
- `--only-story-names`: If you have some specific stories which are causing problems, you can use this flag to run a build for just those stories (one or more). If you don't know which stories are available, you can use `--list` to print a list of all stories in your Storybook, though it will require running a Chromatic build.

## Migrating to the new CLI package

This package was previously named `storybook-chromatic`. If you still have `storybook-chromatic` installed, you should remove it and install `chromatic` instead:

**With npm:**

```shell
npm uninstall --save-dev storybook-chromatic
npm install --save-dev chromatic
```

**With yarn:**

```shell
yarn remove storybook-chromatic
yarn add --dev chromatic
```

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary> I see "Chromatic: Failed to publish. Reason: self signed certificate in certificate chain" when running the CLI on my machine.</summary>

This isn't a Chromatic CLI issue. Check if your machine is using special security or network settings before running the CLI.
